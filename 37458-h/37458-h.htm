</div>
<p>
<span class='sc'>Dear Girls Everywhere</span>:
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you will like these country life
books better for knowing that the incidents told
in them actually happened to me in my girlhood
days. I did not live on a farm such as Natalie’s,
however, nor was my father a farmer. He liked
to “putter” around the acre of ground after
business hours, simply because he enjoyed such
recreation. I was generally at his heels, and
whenever a fruit-tree was being grafted, or a
swarm of bees hived, you could always find me
there, too, getting in Daddy’s way. If I was not
in the garden, or at the barnyard, I would be
shadowing my brothers who were my seniors.
Scouts were unheard of in those days, but
we hiked, camped, fished and did all the enjoyable
stunts which you Scouts now do.
</p>
<p>
I have not the space here to tell you of some
of the hair-raising “dares” my brothers tempted
me to accomplish, but I will have to write them
for you to read, some time. However, the stunts
and the following results would never be termed
ladylike, nor were they graceful. Freckles, tan,
and tattered dresses were the bane of my mother’s
life, and the inglorious title of “tomboy”
failed to curb my delight in the freedom of country
life. But, dear girls, I stored away a fund
of health and experiences that I can now draw
upon without bankrupting myself.
</p>
<p>
A keen desire, which I hope to realize soon, is
to have a place like Green Hill, where you girls
can come and camp for as long a time as you like.
Then we can sit about the campfire and talk
about the fun and frolics the out-of-door life
gives us. Many a laughable experience will I
then tell you. Until that time, dear girls, believe
me to be an ardent admirer of and staunch
worker for the Girl Scouts.
</p>

<h1>Natalie: A Garden Scout</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—NATALIE SOLVES A PROBLEM</h2>
<p>
“Here comes Natalie Averill, girls!” exclaimed
Janet Wardell, as a slender, pale-faced
girl of fifteen came slowly down the walk from
the schoolhouse door.
</p>
<p>
“My! Doesn’t she look awful?” said Frances
Lowden.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Nat! I should say she did!” agreed
Norma Evaston sympathetically.
</p>
<p>
“She looks as if the end of the world had come
for her,” remarked Belle Barlow, the fourth girl
in this group of chums.
</p>
<p>
“Not only the end of the world, but ‘the end
of her rope,’ too,” added Janet, in a low tone so
that no one else might hear.
</p>
<p>
“If it’s true—what mother heard yesterday—the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
end of Nat’s rope has come,” hinted Norma
knowingly.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked the girls anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing new for poor Natalie to suffer
from, I hope,” said Helene Wardell, Janet’s
younger sister and not a member of the clique of
five girls, although she often walked to and from
school with her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” replied Norma, aware of her important
news, “it is about the worst thing that can
happen to a girl after she has lost mother and
father. Mrs. James confided to mother last
night that there isn’t a cent for poor Nat. The
lawyer said that Mr. Averill kept up appearances
but he had no capital. He must have spent all
the money he made since Natalie’s mother died
four years ago.”
</p>
<p>
“How perfectly dreadful for Nat!” cried
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“After the luxurious manner of life she has
had, too,” added Belle.
</p>
<p>
“S-sh! Not so loud, girls; she will hear us,”
warned Helene, the tender-hearted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did Mrs. James tell your mother what they
would do?” whispered Frances anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“She said she would stay on with Natalie for
a time, without salary, as she has learned to love
her so. You know she has been her companion
for four years! And Rachel declares <em>she</em> won’t
go even if the world turns upside down,” returned
Norma.
</p>
<p>
“Just like good old Rachel,” declared
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“But they can’t live in New York without a
cent of money, you know,” said Janet, with deep
concern. “Folks have to pay rent and have
something to eat, wherever they are.”
</p>
<p>
But there was no opportunity to discuss more
of Natalie’s problems then, as the girl came up
and joined her friends. Her whole carriage denoted
utter discouragement, and her face was
drawn into lines of anguish.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Nat dear! What made you stay in
after school?” asked Janet cheerily, placing an
arm about the girl’s shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“I had to tell Miss Mason that I would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
finish the term at school,” returned Natalie in
a quivering voice.
</p>
<p>
“No! Why not?” asked several voices.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I expect to leave the city very
soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Where to?” chorused her companions anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, girls! I hate to think of it, it is so awful
after all I had hoped to do and be, for Daddy’s
sake!” cried the girl, hiding her face in her
hands.
</p>
<p>
Instantly four girls closed in about her
and each one had a loving and sympathetic
word of encouragement to say to her. In a few
moments, Natalie dried her eyes and tried to
smile.
</p>
<p>
“Janet will think it is wonderful, because she
always <em>did</em> like a farm,” said she. “But the only
choice in life now given me, is to move away to an
outlandish farm up State, and leave all my
friends and favorite pastimes behind. When I
think of having to live all my days on a barren
bit of land, I wish I were dead!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
Janet tried to change the subject. “What
did Miss Mason say when you told her you
would not complete the year here?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you know what a faddist she is over that
Girl Scout organization! Well, she talked to
me of nothing but my splendid opportunities of
opening a Country Camp on the farm and renting
out the woodland to girls who would be glad
to use it.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Natalie, is it your own farm?” asked
Janet and Norma.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course! Didn’t I tell you about
it?” cried the girl impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“No, we thought it was someone else’s farm—Mrs.
James’, or Mr. Marvin’s, perhaps,” explained
Belle, gently.
</p>
<p>
“It used to be my great-grandmother’s place.
Mother was born there, but raised in the city.
When grandmother died, Aunt stayed on there
until she, too, died. Then it descended to
mother, who leased it to a man for ten years. I
have never even seen the horrid place, but I know
it is a mile from anywhere on the map. Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
Marvin says it is fine, and <em>he</em> wants me to go and
live there.”
</p>
<p>
“It sounds all right, Nat, if the house is habitable,”
remarked Janet, the practical girl of the
group.
</p>
<p>
“I told Mr. Marvin to sell it for me, but he
says I would be foolish to do that. He says I
can live on it for some years and then sell it when
I grow up and get more for it than if I sold it in
its present condition. He says I could spend my
summers there and try to grow strong and happy
again, and in a few years he could ask a far better
price for the property than would be advisable
now. I reminded him of all the families who
wanted homes, but he said the cost of building
was so high that few sensible investors would
consider buying an old house that needed remodelling.
So there I am!”
</p>
<p>
“How big a house is it, Nat?” asked Janet, as
a thought flashed through her mind.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Marvin motored over there a few weeks
ago, but I refused to go with him. Jimmy went,
however, and has been raving over the place, ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
since. I just had to tell her to keep quiet about
it, or I’d run away from her.”
</p>
<p>
Helene laughed softly: “But that isn’t telling
us how large a house you have on the farm!”
</p>
<p>
“What difference would it make?” retorted
Natalie plaintively. “The very size of the barracks
is a thorn in my side. It is a two-story affair,
with long rambling wings. Jimmy says it
is pure Colonial—whatever that means—and
declares it is an ideal home.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, for goodness’ sake, Nat, why are you
so glum? Any other girl would jump out of her
skin for joy if she were left such a wonderful
inheritance,” rebuked Norma gently.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you girls understand? It isn’t the
house or farm I abhor so much as the isolation
I shall have to live in. That splendid auto-tour
I planned for the five of us is now out of the
question. Even the apartment Daddy and I
were so happy in, is too expensive for my income.
If I can manage to keep any of my parents’
lovely furnishings, I shall be more than lucky.”
</p>
<p>
Her hearers were silenced by her pathetic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
complaint, but their teacher, Miss Mason, now
came from the front door of the school and
smiled invitingly at them. She was a great favorite
with all the girls of her class, and these five
in particular. She came straight over and stood
with a hand affectionately resting on Natalie’s
shoulder as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
“Have you heard of Natalie’s good fortune,
girls?” asked she cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“I thought it was fine, but Nat says I don’t
understand,” said Janet eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe Natalie can comprehend the
fullness of the cup of opportunity that is handed
her, until she sees the place with her own eyes.
It is often difficult to visualize the possibilities in
an idea from another’s description. If you girls
want to have a little outing on Saturday, I shall
be delighted to drive you to Green Hill Farm in
my brother’s car. He has a seven passenger machine,
you know, and will not be home to use it,
this week-end,” said Miss Mason graciously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Nat! Won’t that be fine?” exclaimed
several girlish voices eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“It will be a lovely trip, Miss Mason, and I’m
sure we will all enjoy it,” grudged Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we can tuck Mrs. James in, somewhere,
so she can play major-domo for us when
we arrive at the farm,” added Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” admitted Natalie. “That is, if she
cares to go again.”
</p>
<p>
“This is Thursday, so we have to-morrow to
make our final plans. If all is well, we can start
out Saturday morning about ten,” ventured
Miss Mason, leaving no room for argument.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll ask Jimmy when I go home, and let you
know what she says,” said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you girls going now?” asked
Miss Mason, with seeming guilelessness, but with
intent aforethought.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Helene and I are going home, and
Nat was invited to stay for dinner and spend the
evening,” replied Janet. “Norma and Francie
are coming over after dinner, and bring Ned
Foster and his cousin. They have a motion-picture
camera, you know, Miss Mason, and it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
such fun taking moving pictures of each
other.”
</p>
<p>
“That will be fine! Natalie will enjoy seeing
herself as a screen star, won’t you, Nat dear?”
laughingly replied the teacher.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know, Miss Mason! Nothing is
worth while any more. I just wish I were
dead!” sighed the girl.
</p>
<p>
“No you don’t, Honey! It is just morbid
sorrow that’s fastened itself in your heart. The
moment you change your entire present state of
mind for a more harmonious one, you will feel
like a new being. Now run along with your
chums and have a real—r-e-e-l—happy time.”
Miss Mason’s joyous nature was contagious, and
smiles appeared where intense feelings had
drawn faces awry. So it was with Natalie: as
Miss Mason turned to go down the street, she
stood smiling after her, with a lighter heart than
she had carried for many days.
</p>
<p>
The five girls walked arm-in-arm along the
city street regardless of inconvenienced pedestrians
who had to give way for them. But four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
of the girls vied with each other in cheering
Natalie into a happy mood, for they felt so sorry
for her.
</p>
<p>
The five schoolmates had known each other
for more than five years, and being very near an
age and in the same class in school, naturally became
intimates. Janet Wardell lived a few
blocks from Belle Barlow and Norma Evaston;
and Frances Lowden and her brothers boarded
at a Family Apartment Hotel, two blocks west
of Norma’s home. Natalie Averill, supposedly
the wealthiest girl in school, lived on Riverside
Drive, in one of the modern apartment houses.
</p>
<p>
A few years previous to the opening of this
story, Natalie’s mother passed away, and Mr.
Averill devoted all his love and spare time to his
motherless daughter. She was past the age
when so much attention could spoil her disposition,
but since her father’s death it was all the
harder for her to live without such love and pampering.
Even the funds that used to provide
everything she asked for had vanished, and
henceforth she must go without the things that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
had made her life so pleasant for a few
years.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James, lovingly called “Jimmy” by
Natalie, had accepted the position of companion
and mother to the little girl, when Mr. Marvin
explained the situation. As Mr. Marvin was one
of Mr. Averill’s closest friends, as well as being
his attorney, his recommendation of Mrs. James
was sufficient.
</p>
<p>
As for Mrs. James, a lady in birth and training,
she knew Mr. Marvin would never offer her
the home and charge of anyone that was not her
equal in life. Being penniless was no disgrace,
but she had found it most unpleasant when she
met her old-time friends and could not feel free
to accept invitations because of her limited circumstances.
</p>
<p>
This lovely home with every luxury, and her
freedom in time and ways, made the position an
attractive one for her. So she had held the reins
of government very successfully since Mrs.
Averill’s passing, and Mr. Averill’s appreciation
of it was shown in his last words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
From perfect health and happy hours with his
little daughter, Mr. Averill had suddenly been
taken with acute indigestion and in an hour was
gone. It was all so unexpected and helpless,
that Natalie had not grasped the meaning of it
until the day of the funeral. Then she gave way
to hysterics and daily became more morbid and
despondent.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Marvin had confided to Mrs. Mason that,
in spite of there being so much ready money on
hand whenever it was asked for in Mr. Averill’s
lifetime, there was nothing left for Natalie’s future.
When the funeral expenses were paid not
a dollar would be on hand for rent, or food, or
clothing. There were some rare and expensive
paintings, antiques, and rugs, but they would be
the only things that could be turned into ready
money.
</p>
<p>
The lawyer had not given a thought to the
farm in the Westchester Hills that had belonged
to Mrs. Averill’s mother, as it had always been
mentioned in an apologetic manner. So, naturally,
Mr. Marvin believed it to be a tiny patch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
of poor land with a cottage of some kind on
it.
</p>
<p>
Consequently he was all the more surprised
when he opened the deed of the place, and found
it was located a few miles west of White Plains,
and a mile east of the Hudson Division of the
New York Central Railroad. As he read down
the printed page of the legal paper and found
there were thirty acres of good land,—ten tillable,
ten woodland, and ten pasturage,—with a
substantial dwelling and some out-houses on it,
he heaved a deep sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
He telephoned Mrs. James at once, and explained
the finding of the deed and what it meant
for Natalie’s future. He also invited the chaperone
and Natalie to go out with him and inspect
the property that he might get an idea of the rent
he should ask for it—or what price to value it in
case he could find a purchaser.
</p>
<p>
Natalie would not go when the time came, so
she knew not what the place looked like. It was
enough for her that her dear mother had never
wanted to live there and Daddy hardly ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
mentioned it. Mr. Marvin could rent or sell it
as he liked—but she would not take an interest
in it.
</p>
<p>
To her utter disgust, Natalie found both Mrs.
James and Mr. Marvin so delighted with the old
farm that neither spoke of a sale, or of renting it.
It seemed to be a settled fact that Natalie and
her chaperone would move out and live there for
the summer.
</p>
<p>
When the girl heard the verdict, she stormed
away from the room and fled to the refuge she
had always sought when she had been thwarted
in anything in the past. That was Rachel’s big
brown arms. Rachel had been housekeeper,
cook, and nurse, alternately, in the Averill family.
And the kind-hearted old colored mammy
never failed “her li’l’ chile.”
</p>
<p>
But this time, when Natalie wept tears of misery
over the idea of going to live on a farm,
Rachel explained how much better that would be
than to be adopted by a stranger, or have to live
in a cheap boarding-school somewhere in the
country.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
Natalie had not dreamed of such an alternative,
and as her old confidante described the
hardships of being a poor scholar in a cheap
boarding-school, or a handy-help in form of an
adopted child in a working family, her tears vanished
and a feeling of dread of such experiences
caused her to consider the farm with a better
grace. But it was not with enthusiasm or cheerfulness
that she told her school friends her plans
for the future.
</p>
<p>
So Miss Mason left the girls to enjoy the evening,
while she hurried across town until she
reached the address on Riverside Drive, where
she hoped to find Mrs. James at home.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—A SECRET CONCLAVE</h2>
<p>
“Good-afternoon, Mrs. James,” said Miss
Mason cheerily, as she entered the hall of the
apartment belonging to the Averills.
</p>
<p>
“To what happy circumstance do I owe this
unexpected call?” asked Mrs. James, taking the
teacher’s hand in warm welcome.
</p>
<p>
“It was quite unpremeditated, and consequently
I am unprepared with an answer,”
laughed Miss Mason. “But I can confess to
being one of those objectionable persons that always
want to run other people’s affairs for them.
I just left the five girls at the corner of Broadway,
and hearing that Natalie would not be
home this afternoon, I took advantage of that
knowledge to run in and have a talk with you.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very glad you did, as I have thought of
asking your advice about a step Mr. Marvin advises
me to take for the child.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that is the very business I came on.
I want to help you run your affairs, you see, so I
am here to offer my experiences in certain lines,
and then I will try to encourage Natalie to look
at a country life with different eyes than she has
stubbornly used, recently,” explained Miss
Mason.
</p>
<p>
“Is it about the farm proposition?” asked
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I left the girls talking it over, but
Natalie seems to think she is giving up all that is
worth living for, by going to live at Green Hill
Farm.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that is her attitude, exactly! Whereas
Mr. Marvin says she ought to be the most grateful
girl alive to find she has a lovely home ready-made
to go into, instead of moving to a shabby
school life where she will have to earn part of her
expenses by waiting on table or doing chores,”
explained Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Just so. And because I heard of the poor
child’s destitution, I am here to suggest several
pleasant and wholesome plans by which she can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
not only live without cost to herself this summer
on the farm, but also make enough money to pay
your and her own way in the city next winter.
Perhaps you are not interested in such suggestions?”
ventured Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“Interested? My dear friend, you come like
a blessing from heaven with this news. The
only great obstacle to our going to the farm at
once was the lack of money to stay there, with
Rachel, all summer. No matter where one lives,
one has to eat and abide. And eating costs
money, and an abode needs furniture. The old
house is empty and has to be completely furnished
before we can move out there,” explained
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, listen to my idea. It has been
tried out so successfully before, that I am not
afraid to advise you to experiment for this season,
anyway. It is this:
</p>
<p>
“You know what an enthusiastic member of
the Girl Scouts’ organization I am? Last year
I offered my services free to a camp of girls who
wanted to spend the summer away in the woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
but had no place to go to without its costing a
great deal, and no one would attend them in a
camp which would be within their means. Then
I happened in and saw how hungry these seven
girls were for an outdoor life, so I offered them
a corner of the woods on my brother’s old farm
down in Jersey. Some day I will tell you the
story of our summer down there. It is worth
hearing.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason laughed to herself as she stopped
for a moment to review mentally that experience.
Then she proceeded.
</p>
<p>
“Now this is my idea: Natalie and the other
four girls have been talking of joining the Girl
Scouts ever since last fall, when I returned from
camp. But they are like so many other well-meaning
girls—they never quite reach the point
where they act!
</p>
<p>
“My seven girls who spent the summer in
camp with me last year are begging me to take
them this year again. I have agreed to do so if
we can find a good camp-site not so far from
home as the Jersey farm was. I wish to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
nearer a railroad than last year, too. We were
more than nine miles from any store, or trolley,
so it was most inconvenient to get any supplies.
</p>
<p>
“If Green Hill Farm is anything like what
Natalie described it to me, after school this afternoon,
I would rent some of that woodland in a
minute. She said the stream ran through the
farm at one corner where the woodland watered
ten acres. If Mr. Marvin will rent me enough
of that land for a camp for my Girl Scouts it
will bring in instant returns, and you will not
have cause to regret it.
</p>
<p>
“By having my girls on the ground, I can
rouse the interest of Natalie and her friends (if
they visit her this summer), and in that way they
will want to join my girls. We now have a
Troop in process of organization, with the required
eight members—a new Scout has joined
since last year. These girls are about the same
age as our five schoolmates, so there would be no
disparity in years. I have been elected as Captain
of the Patrol, but we have not yet chosen a
Corporal for this year, as our meetings have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
very irregular since school examinations began.
</p>
<p>
“These Girl Scouts became interested last
spring, but not one of them attends my school, so
I see little of them excepting when they call on
me, or I attend one of their gatherings. Now
that we are started on founding a Troop, we
shall have weekly meetings and all the rest of the
programme.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason waited to hear if Mrs. James had
anything to say about her suggestion, and the
latter asked: “Do you think these seven—or
eight—Scouts are on the same social plane as
Natalie and her friends?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do, or I would never have suggested
their coming into contact with our five girls.
They are not wealthy girls, and each one will
have to support herself in a short time, but they
are fine,—morally, mentally, and spiritually. A
few of them are not perfect physically, and that
is why I wish to give them another long summer
out in the open. It is the best thing a young girl
can do to build up her strength and health.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“That is a great relief—to hear they are good
girls. I have been very careful of my girl’s associations,
you know, and now that her father is
not present to protect her, I will have to use more
precaution and better judgment than ever. This
is one of the main reasons I have for urging her
to live out of the city for a time.”
</p>
<p>
“My Girl Scouts can be of great assistance to
Natalie, if she will show a genuine interest in us.
For instance, one of the members of my newly-fledged
Patrol lived on a farm all her life before
she moved to New York two years ago. She
knows everything necessary for light gardening
and barnyard stock. If you had any idea of
planting the vegetable garden, or keeping chickens,
Alice Hastings can show you how to do
it.”
</p>
<p>
“I had not thought so far as that—gardening
and poultry—but there is a splendid lucrative
business for a girl, I should say!” declared Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“Of course!” agreed Miss Mason. “And
with a little care and good selection, a garden can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
be made to keep a houseful of people. Rachel
is a good cook, and you are a thorough housekeeper,
so what is there to interfere with Natalie
having a few good boarders stay at the house
during the summer?”
</p>
<p>
“That was my idea, when I first saw the farm.
I told Mr. Marvin that we could ask very good
prices and fill the spare-rooms, if Natalie would
consent to it. We will need some money for repairs
and necessary furniture for the extra chambers,
but that is all. We have our housekeeping
things, and quantities of linen for all purposes,
besides bedroom furniture for five good rooms.
I figure that the amount realized on the sale of
the Oriental rugs and draperies, the pictures and
antiques, would pay for all extras we may need,
and give us capital with which to launch a boarding-house
for the summer,” explained Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“If you could find a number of girls of Natalie’s
own age to spend the summer with you,
would you not feel more at ease about the responsibility
of the undertaking?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, of course! I am perfectly at home with
girls, you know. And they would not demand
such attention as adult guests, either,” said Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“True! Then why not offer to chaperone a
number of paying girls of Natalie’s age for the
season? There are so many parents who would
like their girls to benefit by a summer in the
country, but neither mother nor father can leave
home, so the girl has to remain also, because of
no suitable guardian to chaperone her!” declared
Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure your idea is practical. And I will
speak to Mr. Marvin about it. If only Natalie
would think favorably of the farm plan.” Mrs.
James sighed as she thought of the protests and
tears she had to contend with whenever the subject
was broached to Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you what I proposed to the girls just
before I left them, then I must run along. I
invited them to go out and see Green Hill Farm
on Saturday. I said I would get my brother’s
car and motor out, so they could judge of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
place,—whether it would make a pleasant home
for the season or not.”
</p>
<p>
“How very kind of you, Miss Mason!” exclaimed
Mrs. James. “Mr. Marvin’s automobile
is too small to carry more than three of us,
and then we are squeezed close together. He
said he wanted an extra seat added, but everything
is so backward this year, the company
would not promise to deliver the car at all, if a
seat had to be attached. Now this invitation of
taking Natalie with her friends is far better
than driving her over there alone. It will seem
much more desirable to her if her chums praise
the farm and house.”
</p>
<p>
“That was my idea! And while they are
roaming about the place, you and I might look
over the chambers and other rooms indoors, and
average up what might be the income from a
number of paying girls,” added Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“What a fairy-godmother you are, Miss
Mason!” declared the elder woman. “Natalie
always said you were a dear, but I find you a
most valuable adviser, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. James, who would not move heaven
and earth to help a poor little child like Natalie,
in her loss and forlorn state? Were it not for
you being with her, I think she would have followed
her father from sheer lack of interest in
life. That is often the case, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know; but I am sure we have passed
the worst phase in her sad experience, and
will now turn our backs on the morbid sorrow
and face the gladsome light,” said Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“That is one reason she ought to be in the
country—where she is free from all memories
and can find a new interest in life. But young
companions are necessary, too, to suggest daily
fun and work to each other.”
</p>
<p>
“Did the girls seem pleased with your proposal
to take them to the farm on Saturday?”
asked Mrs. James, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, indeed! They were all delighted, so
I left them with a date for ten o’clock in the
morning. The girls can assemble here and I
will call promptly with the car. Now I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
really be going.” Miss Mason rose as she spoke,
and held out her hand to her hostess.
</p>
<p>
“All I can say is, you’ll be laying up treasures
in heaven for yourself if you give your summer
vacation to girls who need the outing. Their
gratitude and love will be a crown in the future,
that you may well be proud of.”
</p>
<p>
“I will enjoy myself, too, never fear!”
laughed the teacher.
</p>
<p>
“I wish there were more like you, then!”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we had best not speak to Natalie of
our talk this afternoon,” ventured Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“No, I won’t mention your call. And we
will let all other things work out naturally,—even
the plan of taking girls to board this summer.
We will wait and see if Natalie has any
plans of her own,” returned Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
So the teacher said good-by and left. Both
women felt happy and confident that Natalie’s
problems were being solved after this confidential
chat. And when Natalie came home late
that evening she was gayer than she had been for
many weeks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do you think, Jimmy!” cried she, as
she ran in to kiss Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I’m thinking it is something good, Honey,”
returned the lady.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Helene’s and Janet’s mother said to-night
that if I went to Green Hill Farm to stay
this summer she would like to send them with
me to <em>board</em>! Isn’t that interesting—to get an
income out of my friends that way, while they
feel that it will be a great favor on your part if
the girls can come!”
</p>
<p>
“I should be very glad to take care of them,
Natalie, if you think you would like to have them
live with us this season,” replied Mrs. James,
wisely refraining from mentioning a word about
her talk with Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“And the moment Frances heard of the idea,
she said she would coax and <em>coax</em> until her
mother said she could come, too! That started
Norma, naturally! And Belle declared that she
would never stay home alone in New York if we
all were having fun on the farm. In the end,
Jimmy, all five girls were ready to leave home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
to-night, and start for the farm!” Natalie
laughed merrily at remembrance of the eagerness
of her friends to go and live on the farm.
And Mrs. James was made happy at hearing
that care-free laugh,—the first one the girl had
given since her father was taken away.
</p>
<p>
“When Mrs. Wardell heard that I didn’t
want to go to the farm, she said I was ‘cutting
off my nose to spite my face.’ And she said I
wouldn’t act so set against it if I would use a
little wisdom and common sense in my thinking
over the whole affair. Then Mr. Wardell told
me what wonderful times every one has in the
summer on a good farm. He said that any
Westchester farm in that locality was most desirable.
So I need not feel that I was going to
live on a poverty-stricken patch of land, because
I would be, most likely, within arm’s reach
(metaphorically speaking, he said) of plenty of
millionaires who loved quiet country life, and
found it in the Westchester Hills. So now I am
as curious to see my only home as you could want
me to be.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m thankful for it,” sighed Mrs. James.
“And I’m thankful to the Wardells for changing
your opinions about Green Hill.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—GREEN HILL FARM</h2>
<p>
Saturday morning Miss Mason drove her
brother’s car up to the curb before the elegant
apartment house where Natalie lived, and motioned
the door-man to come out.
</p>
<p>
“Please telephone to the Averills’ apartment
and say Miss Mason is waiting in the car. Let
me know if they are ready.”
</p>
<p>
The uniformed attendant bowed politely and
hurried in to obey the order. In a few moments
Miss Mason heard a happy voice calling from
the window in one of the upper apartments. She
leaned out and tried to look up, but all she could
see was a fluttering of several handkerchiefs
waved from several hands.
</p>
<p>
Then the porter came out and smilingly said:
“Mrs. James says they will be right down,
Miss.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” was Miss Mason’s reply, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
she sat back to wait. But she had not very long
for that, as a bevy of merry girls hurried out of
the front door and ran across the walk.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Mason! Isn’t it a glorious day?”
called Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t be finer if we had ordered it for our
trip!” added Belle joyously.
</p>
<p>
“And what do you think, Miss Mason?” cried
Natalie, as happy as the others. “Jimmy had
Rachel pack us a lovely picnic lunch so we could
spend some time at the farm this noon. Won’t it
be fun?”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed it will—especially if that famous
cook of yours prepared the goodies, Natalie,”
laughed Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy will be down with us in a minute,
Miss Mason,” added Natalie; “she just stopped
to telephone Mr. Marvin that we were all going
to motor out to the farm. Maybe he can come
out, too, and join us there.”
</p>
<p>
“That will be splendid, as he can explain matters
we may not understand,” returned Miss
Mason.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure there’s nothing to understand about
a farm,” ventured Natalie, laughingly.
</p>
<p>
“You say that because you never lived on one.
But once you do, you will find out that the soil
on your garden will have a great deal to do with
the success of your vegetables. Even flowers
need certain grades of soil before they grow to
perfection. If you have a pasture lot on the
farm, the quality of the grass will control the
grade and amount of milk from the cows; it will
prove valuable, or otherwise, to your horses, to
the sheep, or other stock. Even the chickens
that scratch over the field will show results in the
good or poor soil they feed in.”
</p>
<p>
“Why! How very interesting!” exclaimed
Janet, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“But that need not bother us, Miss Mason, as
vegetables and stock will not come into our
lives,” laughed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James had come out of the house and
now she heard what Natalie said. “My dear
child, one of the main reasons for our going to
live on the farm is to offset the high cost of living
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
in the city. By raising our own vegetables and
eggs and chickens, we can live for one-tenth of
the cost in the city.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Jimmy, not one of us knows a thing
about farming!” chuckled Natalie, amused at the
very idea.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you don’t know anything, but I do,
Natalie.” Mrs. James spoke gently. “I spent
a few years of my early married life on a lovely
farm near Philadelphia, dear, and there is not
very much that I did not learn while there. To
make a success of the investment, I found I had
to take hold, personally, and not only supervise
the work, but know <em>how</em> to do it, and to <em>do</em> it if
occasion demanded it of me.”
</p>
<p>
“Now it will just come in fine for Nat, won’t
it?” declared Janet, enthusiastically. Mrs.
James and the teacher laughed appreciatively at
the remark.
</p>
<p>
“Do tell us, Jimmy,—did Mr. Marvin say he
would try to meet us at Green Hill?” asked
Natalie, as the car started.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he said he would try to get an old friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
to accompany him. He was not sure that she
could get away, but he proposed trying to coax
her to do so.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it an old friend of his?” asked Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, a friend of many years’ standing,” replied
Mrs. James, smiling down at her idle
hands.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know her?” continued Natalie, seeing
the smile.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes,—very well indeed!”
</p>
<p>
“Do I know her, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you know her.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we all know her,—do we?” asked
Janet suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,—you all know her,” laughed Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“Who can it be?” exclaimed several voices,
but Janet tossed her head and smiled knowingly
at Mrs. James. The latter placed a finger on
her lips for secrecy, and Janet nodded.
</p>
<p>
Many guesses were given but no one thought
of the right name, and Mrs. James refused to
divulge the secret. Then so many interesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
sights were seen, as they drove swiftly along the
Boulevard that runs through the Bronx Parkway
and northwards through the pretty country
section of Westchester, that the old friend who
was to join them later at Green Hill Farm was
eclipsed.
</p>
<p>
After a pleasant drive of less than an hour,
Miss Mason turned off the Central Avenue road
and followed a cross-country road that ran
through the village where the farmers of that
part of the country did their shopping and got
their mail.
</p>
<p>
“If this is a village, where are the stores?”
asked Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I see it!” exclaimed Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I see a little house with a few brooms
standing on the front stoop. A sign swinging
over the door says ‘Post Office,’—but you don’t
mean to say that is our only shop?” laughed
Natalie, as she jeered at the general country
store.
</p>
<p>
“That is the ‘Emporium’ for Green Hill,”
said Mrs. James.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“No wonder, then, that we’ll have to raise our
own food and other necessities,” retorted Natalie
humorously.
</p>
<p>
The girls laughed, for truly the small store
had amused them. New York stores were so
different!
</p>
<p>
A mile further on, Mrs. James called to Miss
Mason: “We are almost there now. It is the
first house on the right-hand side of the road.
You can see the towering trees of the front lawn
from here.”
</p>
<p>
Instantly every pair of eyes looked eagerly
down the road and saw the fine big trees mentioned
by Mrs. James. In a few minutes more
the car was near enough to permit everyone to
glimpse the house.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy was right! It is an old peach of a
place!” declared Natalie delightedly, as she took
in the picture at a glance.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Miss Mason. “What a
treasure, Natalie! Genuine old Colonial, Mrs.
James. I shouldn’t wonder if it stood when
Washington led his army across this land to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
reach Dobb’s Ferry. Even the old hand-made
shingles are still siding the house.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I heard it was a Revolutionary relic that
was as well preserved as any house around here.
You see the fine old front entrance? With its
half-moon window over the door and the hood
for protection from storms? Even the old stoop
and the two seats flanking the door, on each side,
are the old ones.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me! To think this gem has been
Natalie’s right along, and no one knew
of it!” cried Belle, who loved antiques and
vowed she was going to be a collector some
day.
</p>
<p>
“Not that alone, Belle, but think how Nat
balked at coming here to spend this summer!”
laughed Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Well, but—I hadn’t an idea of what it was
like,” said Natalie apologetically.
</p>
<p>
“The Law that is the basis of all national
laws, says ‘Ignorance of the Law is no excuse
for a criminal,’” quoted Miss Mason, smiling at
Natalie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, now, once I’ve seen it, I will confess I
like it,” Natalie admitted.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason now drove the car through the
gate which Norma had opened, and the automobile
drew up to the side door where a long piazza
ran the length of the wing. The moment the car
stopped the girls sprang out in haste, to run
about and see the place. But Natalie stood still
on the lowest step of the piazza and gazed in at
an open door.
</p>
<p>
“Someone’s here!” whispered she to her
friends.
</p>
<p>
Before anyone could reply, a buxom form
filled the doorway and a wide grin almost cleft
Rachel’s face in half. She held out both hands
to Natalie, and her expression signified a welcome
to her “Honey-Chile.”
</p>
<p>
“Why! Rachie! How did <em>you</em> get here? I
left you at home!” exclaimed Natalie, not certain
whether it was flesh and blood she saw, or a
phantom.
</p>
<p>
“Diden I come by a short cut, Honey, an’
wa’n’t it a good joke on you-all to beat you to dis
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
fahm!” laughed Rachel, delighting in the mystery.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, now I know! It was Rachel who is our
friend, eh?” shouted Natalie, clapping her
hands.
</p>
<p>
“Shore! Mr. Marwin done brung me in his
speeder by d’ Hudson Riber Turnpike. We
turned offen d’ main road afore we come t’
Dobb’s Ferry. Jus’ d’ udder side f’om Yonkers.
Dat’s how we come so quick,” explained
Rachel.
</p>
<p>
“Where is he? I want to thank him,
Rachel!” cried Natalie, gratitude uppermost in
her thought just then.
</p>
<p>
“You won’t have far to go to find me,”
laughed a genial voice, and everyone turned to
see Mr. Marvin standing behind them.
</p>
<p>
Then followed a visit indoors, with Mr. Marvin
acting as guide from attic to cellar, and his
party stringing out behind. Some loitered in a
room, and then ran to catch up with the main
guard. Or some lingered to admire a view or
interesting object in the house, and hurried after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
the others later, for fear of missing something
worth while.
</p>
<p>
The main hall ran from front to rear of the
house, cutting it in half. On one side of the
wide hallway was a “front parlor,” and back of
it the back-parlor, or “settin’-room,” as the
farmers called it. Across the hall was the dining-room
and pantry, and leading from the pantry
was the kitchen. These rooms were so spacious
that Janet laughingly remarked: “Our
entire apartment would go in one room.”
</p>
<p>
“Look at the wonderful fireplaces!” exclaimed
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“My! One can throw a log three feet long
on the fire and not strike either side of the chimney,”
added Frances.
</p>
<p>
“Girls! Just see the funny little cupboards
built in on each side of the chimney-facing,”
called Norma, opening one of the panels that
fitted snugly to the bricks.
</p>
<p>
Everyone called attention to a different discovery.
Janet laughed at the small wavy-glass
window panes, that twisted the scene outdoors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
into grotesque views. Natalie marvelled at the
great dark beams overhead that were not only
hand-hewn from the timber, but also hand-planed.
Mr. Marvin drew attention to the
wooden pegs used in the corners of these beams,
and the crude nails that a Colonial blacksmith
had beaten into a form that could be used by the
home-builder of the house.
</p>
<p>
“It is all so wonderful, Natalie, it seems like
a dream!” exclaimed Miss Mason, delighted beyond
words.
</p>
<p>
“Look at the heavy planks in the floors!” said
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, even the wood in the floors is hand-sawn
and smoothed down by hand and sandpaper.
These floors will <em>never</em> wear out,” said Mr. Marvin.
</p>
<p>
“Such a room ought to have sand on the floor
instead of carpet. Picture this old house furnished,
attic to parlor, in strictly old-time style,
low wooden beds, high-boys, clothes-presses, and
patchwork quilts adorning the foot of the beds;
in the front hall, a small stand to hold the hand-dipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
candles and sticks; a few braided mats in
the ‘company room’ and in the hall, but not in
the other rooms; and sand,—glistening white
sand,—sprinkled over these floors every few days,
and then washed out when the dust demands it.”
</p>
<p>
As Miss Mason pictured the scene of the interior
after the old Revolutionary period, everyone
saw how lovely such a plan would be. When
they followed Mr. Marvin up-stairs and saw the
extensive view from the landing of the stairs,
Mrs. James said: “Here we must have a seat, so
one can sit and study the lovely, peaceful scene
that stretches away over the hills.”
</p>
<p>
The second floor had been divided into six
rooms, with ample closet space in each. A modern
bathroom had been installed a few years before
by the tenant who had agreed to make all
improvements and repairs at his own expense.
</p>
<p>
“Why! These bedrooms have electric lights
in them!” exclaimed Natalie, thus drawing attention
to the drop-lights.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t see any down-stairs,” said Mrs.
James.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did anyone think to look for them?” asked
Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“No, we were all trying to see your old homestead
with hand-dipped candles. The light they
gave us was so dim we had no way of seeing the
electric lights,” laughed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going down-stairs this minute, and assure
myself if there are any,” declared Miss
Mason.
</p>
<p>
“No one would have them up-stairs and not
have them on the first floor,” said Mr. Marvin.
</p>
<p>
While the others went to the attic to revel in a
real old-time spot, Miss Mason went down to the
first-floor rooms to hunt for electricity. To
her astonishment she found how cleverly the late
tenant had arranged it. That he had a keen appreciation
of the house was evident in many
ways, but in none so plainly as in the lighting.
</p>
<p>
On top of each old-fashioned wooden mantel
that crowned the fireplaces, at the end of each
mantel-board shelf, Miss Mason found the plug
for an electric fixture sunken on a level with the
wood of the shelf. And on each side of the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
opposite the fireplace, she found that the old-fashioned
candlestick fixtures that had been admired
as genuine Colonial bits, had been wired
and were ready for a bulb. Also she discovered
that a wall-plug was cleverly set in the high base-boards
on either side of the room. From these
one could run the wire for a table lamp, or a floor
lamp, as preferred.
</p>
<p>
She hastened up-stairs to tell the others about
it, but when she reached the second floor, such
shouts of delight came from the attic, she could
not resist the curiosity to go up.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Mason! Miss Mason!” shouted Natalie,
the moment she saw the teacher’s head appear
above the stairway. “Just see what we found!”
</p>
<p>
“The very old pieces that Natalie’s grandmother
used!” added Belle, pulling Miss Mason
across the floor.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it all like a fairy tale, Miss Mason?”
laughed Janet, eagerly clasping her hands in her
excitement.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James and Mr. Marvin were dragging
great heavy pieces of mahogany from under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
eaves, and the several objects already brought to
view were being dusted, duly examined and admired
by the young girls.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason saw one fine old high-boy and another
old low-boy. The foot-boards of three mahogany
beds were already out on the floor, and
the two discoverers were working hard to pull out
the other sections of the beds. Miss Mason immediately
went to work to bring to light some
old rush-bottomed chairs which were so covered
with cobwebs and dust that one could scarcely see
them under the dark eaves.
</p>
<p>
When lack of breath caused the three eager
workers to desist and rest for a short time, an inventory
was made. Natalie joyously called
out the items while Mr. Marvin wrote them
down.
</p>
<p>
“Two low-boys; three high-boys; one side-board;
five dining-room chairs with haircloth
covered seats; one round extension table; nine
odd chairs with rush-bottoms; four wash-stands
of mahogany, with basin-holes and under-shelf
for ewer of water; four complete mahogany fourposter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
beds, with rope webbing for springs; one
damaged four-poster bed; box of old candle-sticks,
and snuffers, etc.”
</p>
<p>
“To think that this wonderful old collection
of Colonial furniture was here all these years and
the tenants never took them, or used them!” exclaimed
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“That goes to show how honest they were,”
added Norma.
</p>
<p>
“The finding of this old family furniture certainly
is opportune,” remarked Mr. Marvin.
“With these pieces as a start, you can add to the
collection from time to time. I should advise
you to keep only such pieces from the city home,
Natalie, as will harmonize with old Colonial
things. Also retain any intimate objects, but
sell all the rest that is only suitable for New York
apartments.”
</p>
<p>
As they all went down-stairs again, Miss Mason
remembered the electric fixtures in the rooms
on the first floor.
</p>
<p>
When she told of the admirable manner in
which the wires had been run to bring out the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
best results, in keeping with the type of room,
Mrs. James was surprised.
</p>
<p>
“I would never have thought a farmer had
enough educated judgment to do it. It only
proves how we <em>mis</em>-judge them by considering a
farmer an ignorant individual who does nothing
but grub on his farm.”
</p>
<p>
“Mos’ time you-all come down f’om dat garret.
I done call an’ <em>call</em>, ’til my lungs bust open.
My goodness! dat fine lunch mos’ spiled, now!”
Rachel stood at the foot of the old stairs, glowering
up at the delinquents who had never heard a
sound from her while they were in the attic.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Rachel! We found the loveliest things
up in the attic! Just think, Rachie, my very
own great-grandmother’s mahogany furniture
was tucked away under the dark eaves, and
Jimmy found it!” cried Natalie, catching hold
of Rachel’s fat hands and shaking them excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“Is dat so, Honey?” gasped Rachel, forgetting
all about the luncheon and the tardy guests.
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh! And we are going to keep everything in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
old house strictly Colonial, so it will
look like a picture,” said Natalie, leading the
way to the side verandah where the luncheon had
been spread upon newspaper.
</p>
<p>
Everyone was hungry and Rachel’s viands
were always tempting, so full justice was done
the sandwiches and other good things provided.
Rachel bustled about with importance, as she
waited on her “chillun” and insisted upon Mr.
Marvin having a third cup of tea. Had she but
known the truth—he never took tea in the city,
but dearly liked strong black coffee after a meal.
</p>
<p>
“Now you-all kin clar out and see th’ fahm
whiles I do up the leavin’s f’om lunch. Run
down an’ see d’ riber an’ what fine woods we got
acrost d’ paster-lot. You’ll fin’ plenty to see an’
keep you busy ’til I finishes cleanin’ up,” said
Rachel.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason was intensely interested in the
woods that formed a boundary of the property
along the riverside for a long stretch. Mrs.
James understood her interest, but no one else
had been taken into the teacher’s confidence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
She wished to see possibilities before she spoke of
the Patrol of Girl Scouts who were looking for a
camp-site.
</p>
<p>
However, she found everything so desirable
that she soon engaged Mr. Marvin in a talk that
ended with her having rented a section of woodland
for the summer, at a nominal price. She
was to give Natalie and her friends certain lessons
in scouting and take them on the hikes with
the Scouts when they all studied birds, beasts,
and other Nature-lore, as part of the consideration.
</p>
<p>
It was past three o’clock before the inspectors
were ready to start back home. Rachel had been
sitting on the door-step of the spacious kitchen
for a long time before she spied them coming
across the fields from the stream.
</p>
<p>
“Ef you-all ’specks to get back home in time
fer dinner, we’s got to get a hustle on, ’s all I
say!” grumbled she.
</p>
<p>
“Hoh! Rachel wants to attend Meetin’ to-night,
and she hates being late!” laughed Natalie
teasingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Marvin will get her home all right, long
before we are half-way there,” said Mrs. James
soothingly.
</p>
<p>
“Seein’s this comin’ Sunday’ll be my las’ at
chu’ch fer a hull summer, yuh can’t wonder I
wants to be on time at choir practice t’-night,”
remarked Rachel apologetically to Mr. Marvin.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not! I’ll agree to have you back
in the city in a jiffy! And now that I think of
it, Rachel,—why should you bother to prepare
dinner for us to-day? Let me take the girls out
somewhere for one night, and you will have time
to get to church early in order to say good-by to
all your friends!”
</p>
<p>
As that was all Rachel wished,—to show the
importance of herself and her family who owned
such a fine country-place, and brag about it to
her bosom friends,—she smiled serenely and sat
down in the roadster driven by the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
The others stood and smiled, too, as they
watched Mr. Marvin drive away, and then
turned to get into Miss Mason’s car to start back
to the city.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—GIRL SCOUT FARMERETTES</h2>
<p>
Mrs. James sent word to the storekeeper at
the Corners, directing him to hire help and send
them to Green Hill Farm to clean up the house
thoroughly. Also to see that a man mowed the
lawns and cleaned up the barns and yards.
</p>
<p>
Then came the work of selecting the things
Natalie wished to keep, and packing them ready
to ship to Green Hill. The other furnishings in
the apartment would not be sold until after the
girl was out. Mr. Marvin said there was no
need to cause her any unnecessary heartache.
</p>
<p>
The second week in June, Mr. Marvin sent
word to Mrs. James that the house was ready for
occupancy whenever she wished to move out
there. Not only was the old furniture placed in
the respective rooms, but the pieces that had been
shipped from the apartment in New York were
also arranged for the time being. The only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
things to be moved were the trunks and the cases
containing the dishes and bric-à-brac which Natalie
would keep.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James read the letter to Natalie at the
breakfast table and said: “The sooner we can
get away from here, dear, the better for all. Mr.
Marvin can then save a whole month’s rent for
you, as the owner agreed to cancel the lease when
Mr. Marvin explained the circumstances. If
we remain to the end of this month, it will take
an extra week to dispose of what remains here,
and that will necessitate another month’s rent if
it goes over the first of July.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll be only too glad to get away from
the home where every room and object speaks of
dear Daddy!” cried Natalie. “Green Hill is so
lovely at this time of the year that I feel as if I
could look forward there to meeting Daddy and
mother again without feeling any grief at the
parting now.”
</p>
<p>
“Then let us say we will start in a day or
two!” exclaimed Mrs. James eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“But what about school, Jimmy? Exams
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
will not come off until the third week, and I don’t
want to miss any.”
</p>
<p>
“Natalie, maybe we can arrange some way
with Miss Mason by which you can take yours
without being in school,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see her to-morrow, Jimmy, and if she
says I may do it that way, I’ll go with you at
once.”
</p>
<p>
“If she can’t make such an exception in your
case, Natalie, we may be able to arrange so you
can commute to the city for the few last weeks of
school.”
</p>
<p>
The next noon Natalie hurried home with the
good news that the Principal had been interviewed
and had granted Natalie permission to
take her examinations all at one time during the
next few days of school, as her average for the
year had been so splendid. The fact that she
maintained a high standard all year through in
her classes showed that she would not fail now in
her yearly examinations.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but this is good news, dear!” exclaimed
Mrs. James joyously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, isn’t it? If it wasn’t for Miss Mason
taking the time and interest in me that she does,
the Principal would never have listened to my
request. It seems rather wonderful to have a
teacher who is a real friend, too!”
</p>
<p>
“We’re grateful, no matter through what
channel the good came; but I, too, think Miss
Mason a good friend to have,” remarked Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“She said something to me, as I left this noon,
about your telling me of her Scout camp. She
laughed and said I would be surprised and—perhaps—annoyed.
If it was the latter feeling, I
was to consider she owed me a debt that she
would try to pay as soon as possible. It sounded
so amusing, coming from her to me, who owes
her all obligations for what she has done for me,
that I am keen to hear what you have to explain.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James smiled. “I am sure you will be
pleased, Natalie. Miss Mason rented a section
of the woodland that runs along the river bank
at Green Hill for a camp for her Girl Scout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
Patrol she told us of. They all expect to go
there on the first of July.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goody! Isn’t that just scrumptious!”
cried Natalie delightedly.
</p>
<p>
“I thought you would like it, but Miss Mason
was not so sure that you would welcome her
Scouts. The girls are all good girls, but they
have not had the money or social advantages that
you and your friends have. I told Miss Mason
that the sooner all such fol-de-rol was dispelled
in a girl’s mind the better. And these eight sensible
young girls will help dispel the nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, Jimmy! Since I find myself
thrown on the mercy of the world, I begin to see
how unfounded is one’s faith in money or position.
One day it is yours and the next it is
gone!”
</p>
<p>
“Rather precocious views for so young a
maid, Natalie,” said Mrs. James, smiling indulgently
at her protégée.
</p>
<p>
Natalie sighed. “Is it not true?”
</p>
<p>
“True, of course, but you have not proven it
to be so yet. You speak from hearsay and from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
book knowledge. You have not had to make the
sorry experience your own yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Jimmy! Don’t you call my losses the
test?” said Natalie, offended that Mrs. James
should consider her limited condition anything
less than a calamity.
</p>
<p>
The lady laughed. “Child, you have a lovely
home and land free and clear of debt. It is
worth at <em>least</em> ten thousand dollars right now.
With judicious handling it will be worth four
times that sum in a few years. You have Rachel
and me to live with you and love and cherish you—as
well as protect you. You have Mr. Marvin
to take all charge of your business interests, and
last, but not least—you have four loyal young
friends who stick to you whether you have money
or not. This is far from being thrown on the
cold mercy of the world!”
</p>
<p>
Natalie thought deeply over this but she said
nothing.
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s get busy packing, Jimmy! I
want to get away this week, if we can.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you not going back for the afternoon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
session of school?” asked Mrs. James, surprised.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I tell you I was free now? I do not
have to return except for exams. The classes
are only reviewing the last term’s work now, so I
do not have to report for that.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how nice! Then we will get to work at
once.”
</p>
<p>
By afternoon of Wednesday, all baggage was
out of the apartment, and the three occupants
were prepared to leave early in the morning.
Mr. Marvin had been notified and he said the key
for Green Hill house was at the general store.
Mrs. Tompkins would give it to them. Mr.
Tompkins had followed his wife’s advice and
stocked up the kitchen and pantry with whatever
groceries Rachel would need to begin with.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that thoughtful of the Tompkins, Natalie?”
said Mrs. James gratefully.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I feel that we will be good friends—the
Tompkins and us.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie had informed her schoolmates that she
was to go on the nine o’clock local in the morning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
and so wished them all good-by that
night.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t really ‘good-by,’ Nat, because we
will all see you again so soon,” giggled Norma.
</p>
<p>
Belle sent Norma a warning glance and explained
hastily: “Yes, it is only a few weeks before
we will be up on the farm with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Try to fix it, girls, so you can all join me on
the farm as soon as school closes,” said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“That will be fine!” declared a chorus of
voices.
</p>
<p>
So repeated good-bys were said and Natalie
wondered why the girls thought it all so funny!
The next morning as Mrs. James and Natalie
stood in line at Grand Central Station to buy
their tickets, four laughing girls pounced upon
Natalie, and as many girlish voices said: “Didn’t
you suspect? How could you believe we would
let you go away without sending you off in a
royal manner?”
</p>
<p>
Natalie laughed joyously. “But it isn’t to
the North Pole, girls! And it is only a few
weeks before you will be there.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never mind! If it is only for a few days,
we would see that the railroad company was duly
impressed with your importance because of your
friends who escort you to the train,” laughed
Janet.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James had purchased the tickets by this
time, and they all started to find Rachel, who was
waiting with the baggage. Then they hunted
up the particular gate that gave way to the platform
of the train they wanted, and passed
through in a grand procession.
</p>
<p>
Rachel was last to pass, and as she tried to
force the unwieldy bags through without allowing
for the narrow brass rails, she got them stuck.
A porter sprang forward to assist her, but she
scorned him.
</p>
<p>
“Whad foh yoh try t’ show off <em>now</em>? Ef yoh
had any sence in yoh haid, yoh’d seen I cud have
used help befoh dis! Clar out, now, and don’
show yoh kinky monkey-face heah ag’in!”
</p>
<p>
As she puffed out the angry words, Rachel
struggled with the baggage, and finally shot
through with the release of the knobby portmanteau
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
that held her precious property. The gate-keeper
laughed quietly at the discomfiture of the
porter who was inordinately proud of his new
uniform and brass-corded cap. To be termed a
“monkey-face” by an old mammy was past endurance!
</p>
<p>
The incident caused a merry laugh with the
group of girls, and Natalie said: “There, Rachel!
I told you to let us carry one or two of your bags,—you
were too laden for anything!”
</p>
<p>
“Da’s all right, Honey! I ain’t lettin’ yoh
lug yohse’f to pieces fer me; but dat pickaninny
what’s dressed up like a hand organ monkey
makes his livin’ by fetchin’ an’ carryin’; so he
oughta know his bis’nis, er someone’s got to teach
him it.”
</p>
<p>
As Natalie reached the platform of the train,
she stood still to bid her chums good-by again.
Suddenly she remembered what had occurred the
night before.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, is that why you laughed when I said it
need not be a long good-by?”
</p>
<p>
“Surely! we had it all planned to come and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
see you off, and give you consolation in some tangible
form because you would be deprived of our
gracious company for two weeks,” giggled Belle,
holding out a ribbon-bowed box.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that for?” demanded Natalie, trying
to act impatient because the girls spent their
money on her. But her acting was very poorly
done.
</p>
<p>
“And I thought you would need some farming
implements at Green Hill, so I managed to secure
these for you,” added Janet laughingly.
</p>
<p>
She held out a long package that defied guessing
as to its contents, so Natalie took it and
laughed merrily with the others.
</p>
<p>
“And I brought your favorite nourishment,
Nat. One of mother’s ‘chocklate’ layercakes,”
said Norma.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my goodness! How shall I carry it
without mashing the icing?” exclaimed Natalie,
managing, however, to place the square box
upon her arm where it was carefully balanced.
</p>
<p>
“And I, Nat,” said Frances, “feared you
would lack fruit on the farm, and so I tried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
start you with a supply from the New York
orchards.”
</p>
<p>
It takes little to make a merry heart laugh,
and at each silly schoolgirl speech made with the
gift Natalie laughed so heartily that it was contagious.
</p>
<p>
“All aboard!” called the conductor, consulting
his timepiece and waving Mrs. James into
the coach.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by! Good-by!” shouted five girls,
and Natalie was bundled into the train and
found herself watching the girls as the train receded
from the station.
</p>
<p>
After she was seated and had tested the box of
candies Belle had given her, Natalie saw Mrs.
James deeply interested in a paper-covered book.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the name of it?” asked she, handing
the candy-box across the aisle to Rachel.
</p>
<p>
“Looks like candy,” replied Rachel, thinking
the girl was speaking to her.
</p>
<p>
Natalie laughed. “I meant the book, Rachie,”
explained she.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James looked up with a half absentminded manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
“What did you say about the
book, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“I asked you what it was. Who wrote it?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it is the new book ‘Scouting for Girls,’
that Miss Mason gave me last night. It is certainly
very interesting, Natalie.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that the Scout Girls’ Manual?” said Natalie,
surprised at the thickness of it.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and ever so good! It is filled, from
cover to cover, with wonderful information. I
never dreamed so much could be found in Nature
that is so absorbing to read about or study.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder why Miss Mason did not give me a
copy?” was Natalie’s rejoinder.
</p>
<p>
“She spoke of it. She said she would send it
by one of the girls this morning. Didn’t you get
it?” asked Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if it is in that box?”
</p>
<p>
As she spoke, Natalie began undoing the cord
that wrapped the long box, and having removed
the paper and then the box-cover, she found not
only the Manual inside, but a hand-trowel and a
weeder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of all things!” laughed she, as she held out
the box to show Mrs. James. “A shovel and a
rake for my garden.”
</p>
<p>
Then it was Mrs. James’ turn to laugh.
“That is not a shovel, nor is the other a rake,
Natalie.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, isn’t it? What is it, then?”
</p>
<p>
“The trowel is used when you wish to dig
shallow holes, or loose-earth trenches. The so-called
rake is a weeder that you can use about
delicate roots, or in forcing deep roots to let go
and come up. Both are very necessary for a
farmer to use about his house-garden.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if I ever have occasion to use them, I
shall remember Janet.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you will be remembering her every day
this summer, I think,” laughed Mrs. James.
“Weeds are the pest of a farmer’s existence.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie was soon absorbed in her Scout book
also, and Rachel was the only one of the trio who
could tell about the scenery they passed as the
train sped on to the nearest station to the secluded
little village near the farm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
As the three travellers left the train and stood
on the old platform of the country station, Natalie
gazed about.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! What a desert for isolation.
Not a human being in sight, and no sign of a
house or barn. Nothing but glaring sign-boards
telling us where to stop in New York for a dollar
per night—private bath extra!” exclaimed she.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James laughed. It was true, but it
sounded funny the way Natalie spoke.
</p>
<p>
“We ain’t got to walk, has we, Mis’ James?”
asked Rachel plaintively.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see anything else to do, Rachel. Do
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Not yet, but mebbe someone’ll come along.
I’d jes’ as soon ride behin’ a mule es not. Th’
misery in my spine is <em>that</em> bad sence I’ve be’n
packin’ and movin’ so hard all week.”
</p>
<p>
“A mule would be welcomed, but there is
none,” laughed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t the landscape beautiful?” said Mrs.
James, gazing about with admiring eyes.
</p>
<p>
“As long as it is all that is beautiful to look at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
at this station, I must agree with you, Jimmy,”
teased Natalie.
</p>
<p>
But both of them now saw Rachel staring
down at the dusty road that ran past the platform,
and when she dropped her bags and started
along the road, acting in a strange manner, Mrs.
James whispered nervously to Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“What can be the matter, Natalie? Can anything
have made her brain turn?”
</p>
<p>
Rachel kept on going, however, bending over
and staring at the dust in the middle of the road.
Natalie was dumbfounded at such queer behavior,
and was about to call to the colored mammy,
when Rachel suddenly stopped, straightened up
and shouted at something hidden from the eyes
of the two who were waiting with the bags.
</p>
<p>
“Heigh dere! Come back foh us, yoh hackman!”
was the echo that was wafted back to the
station and the patient waiters.
</p>
<p>
Both of them laughed heartily. And Natalie
said: “That was what she was doing! Obeying
Scout instructions the first thing, and ‘tracking a
horse’ in the wilds of this land.”
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<img src="images/illus-075.jpg" alt="“Maybe that is the cab Mr. Marvin ordered to meet us.”" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“Maybe that is the cab Mr. Marvin ordered to meet us.”</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>
“Maybe that is the cab Mr. Marvin ordered to
meet us. He said we must not be discouraged if
it turned out to be a ‘one-horse chaise’ instead of
a taxi,” remarked Mrs. James, highly amused at
the experience.
</p>
<p>
Natalie made a vicious slap at a green bottle-fly
that had annoyed her ever since she alighted
from the train. Now she laughed and said:
“Not a one-horse chaise, Jimmy, but ‘one horse-fly’
is here to meet us.”
</p>
<p>
It was such an opportune play on words that
they both laughed merrily. Rachel was now
found to be arguing with a man seated in an antique
vehicle. He seemed to enjoy the conversation
immensely, for he was comfortably
stretched out with his feet up over the dashboard
and his arms resting along the top of the back of
his seat.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go over and add our persuasions to
Rachel’s,” said Natalie, picking up her luggage
and starting away.
</p>
<p>
When they drew near enough to hear the conversation
between Rachel and the man, the former was saying:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
“Yuh don’t know what I kin do
to yoh! Do yuh want to see my pow’ful arm?”
</p>
<p>
The driver sat up at that and looked at the
doubled up thickness of that member of Rachel’s
anatomy. Then he said: “But I always gits
that much a head fer such a long trip.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter here?” demanded Natalie,
coming up to join in the argument.
</p>
<p>
“Chile, dis highway robber wants to take fifty
cents a haid fer takin’ us acrost to Green Hill
Fahm. Why, it ain’t no furder’n f’om heah t’
dere, an’ I tells him it is stealin’. In Noo York
sech profiteers gits what’s comin’ t’ ’em.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James interpolated at this. “Fifty
cents each is not too much, Rachel. But he must
take the luggage as well.”
</p>
<p>
The colored woman retreated at that, and
cabby chuckled. “How much baggage?”
</p>
<p>
“Three suit-cases and these bags and hat-boxes.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see no suit-cases,” mumbled he.
</p>
<p>
“You would, if you had been at the station
where you belong. The station-man took the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
checks and turned the bags over to us before going
away to enjoy himself until the next train
comes in,” retorted Natalie, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“All right; I’ll wait fer yuh ’til yuh git back,”
agreed the driver, preparing to take things easy
again.
</p>
<p>
“See here,” said Mrs. James, sternly. “Are
you Amity Ketchum?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’um,—at your service.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you’re the man our lawyer engaged to
meet the train and drive us to Green Hill. Now
stop your arguing and get those suit-cases, then
take us to our home.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James’ erstwhile good-nature turned
like the proverbial worm and she became very
imperious. So much so, that lazy Amity chirruped
to his horse and went back for the baggage.
When he returned and stopped beside the
ladies, Mrs. James got in and sat on the back
seat that was adjustable to meet demands. Natalie
got in and sat beside her, and Rachel laboriously
climbed up and dropped into the vacant
seat beside the driver. The entire vehicle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
cracked when her ponderous weight fell upon the
old bench, and Amity scowled threateningly at
her black, shiny face.
</p>
<p>
“I gotta stop at Tompkins’ fer some groceries,”
grumbled Amity, with scant ceremony in
his tones.
</p>
<p>
There was silence for the time it took to reach
the “Emporium” at the Corners, but when the
proprietor hurried out to welcome the city people,
the latter smiled and felt better for his
friendliness. Amity had gone inside to get his
order filled, and then came out with arms laden
with packages.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Tompkins followed her customer out to
the steps, and was introduced by her husband to
the three strangers. She was very pleasant and
told Mrs. James to call upon her for anything
she needed or wanted done. After thanking the
gracious woman, Mrs. James was about to ask
her advice on an important matter, but the hackman
gave his horse a cut with the hickory stick,
and almost dislocated his passengers’ necks with
the lurch given the vehicle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
The two storekeepers were left standing on
the steps watching the buckboard pass out of
sight. Mrs. James was angry, but said nothing
more. She knew how Rachel’s temper was instantly
kindled when anyone dared to offend a
member of her revered family, and she understood
just what Amity would get if he was not
more considerate towards them.
</p>
<p>
Having driven little less than a mile along the
good highway, Amity suddenly turned off into a
rough, badly-kept country road. Mrs. James
looked anxiously back, and on each side, then
said: “Mr. Ketchum, this is not the road to
Green Hill Farm. You should have kept right
on that other road.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it!” retorted Amity. “I’m going
this way so’s to leave these vittles at my house fer
dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“Is your house far out on this road?” queried
Mrs. James, after an unusually hard bump of
the vehicle over a deep rut.
</p>
<p>
“Not so fer. I’ll turn down th’ next lane,
and then to the right, and there’s my place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
There’s a back road what runs from my farm to
your woodland. I kin go that way and drive
you up to your barn by a wood-cutter’s road,”
explained Amity.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I hope you won’t find any worse roads
than this is, when we turn into that lane,” was
Mrs. James’ reply. But the words were disconnected
because of the incessant bouncing of
the buckboard along the dried mud and over
large stones imbedded in it.
</p>
<p>
Rachel had to cling with both hands to the
small iron handle at the side of the board seat,
but she fared better than the two in the back seat,
as she was too heavy to be easily moved; and the
driver’s seat was stationary, whereas the second
seat slid dangerously up and down the shallow
grooves into which its side-feet fitted loosely.
The side on which Rachel sat sagged at least ten
inches lower than on Mrs. James’ side, and the
latter found it necessary to balance herself on
her left hip to retain any sort of seat whatever.
</p>
<p>
They had travelled a mile of this sort of roadway
when Cherub, the horse, of his own accord,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
turned in at a gap in the old rail fence and approached
a carelessly-kept farm and dilapidated
house. This private road was far worse than the
one they just left, but Mrs. James and her companions
expressed no impatience over it.
</p>
<p>
Then they came to what might have been a
very picturesque stream, had the banks on both
sides been kept in order. The only visible bridge
over this water was composed of enough loose
planks to give passageway for wagons or cattle.
These old planks were not secured in any way,
and moved threateningly when anything came in
contact with them.
</p>
<p>
On both sides of this crude bridge the rains
had washed out the dirt from under the planks,
so that deep ruts formed. And just before reaching
this rut, on the side of approach by the
vehicle, was a huge boulder that thrust up its
jagged head from the very middle of the rough
roadway.
</p>
<p>
Amity had known of this obstruction in the
road for a long time, but he was too lazy to remove
this menace. He had always managed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
guide the horse so that the wheels just managed
to clear the rock. Sometimes, with a heavy load
on the buckboard, the flooring would scrape
along the top of the stone, but a little nerve-racking
thing like that never phased Amity.
</p>
<p>
This time, however, Cherub was in a great
hurry to get his feed, which he was sure would be
awaiting him in the barn, so he failed to respond
to the usual hard yank on the reins. The consequence
was, one fore-wheel struck sharply in the
middle of the boulder, and brought the buckboard
to an unexpected stop. The awful strain
on the old rotten harness when Cherub pulled
and the vehicle was held up, caused the frayed
rope mendings to part and the eager horse hurried
forward, leaving his unwelcome drag behind.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the violent halt sent the occupants
of the buckboard suddenly forward, so that Mrs.
James unceremoniously struck Amity in the
back and caused him to lose his breath. Had he
not had his feet braced against the foot-rail in
front, he would have fallen forward. Rachel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
not having used the foot-rail and not expecting
any catapulting, went headlong over the old
dashboard. As the board was meant for a screen
from water and mud and not as a support for
such a heavy body as Rachel’s, it splintered and
let her sag down between the empty shafts, her
head resting on the whiffle-tree and her heels
wildly kicking close to Natalie’s head.
</p>
<p>
The two other passengers were too frightened
to notice that Rachel had on her hand-knitted,
gayly striped stockings, brought years ago from
“Norf Car’liny” and only worn on rare occasions;
and Amity was too anxious to coax
Cherub back and save himself any effort by going
for him, to think of assisting Rachel to extricate
herself from the broken-in dashboard.
</p>
<p>
Natalie and Mrs. James jumped out and,
after heroically lifting and pulling, managed to
bring Rachel right-side-up once more. The moment
she learned what had happened, and saw
the driver waiting for Cherub to return, she
shook a doughty fist at him and scolded well.
</p>
<p>
So impressive were her speech and actions that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
Amity considered “discretion to be the better
part of valor” this time, and jumped out to
catch Cherub and bring him back to his job.
While the hackman was away, Rachel turned to
Mrs. James and spoke.
</p>
<p>
“Ef yoh-all pays dat good-fer-nuttin’ one
cent affer my mishap, den I goes straight back t’
Noo York an’ gits d’ law on him to mek him pay
me fer playin’ such tricks on defenseless women.”
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t do it on purpose, Rachel. It was
an accident,” explained Mrs. James, hoping to
placate Rachel before Amity came back with the
horse.
</p>
<p>
“Ah don’ care—akserdent er no akserdent, I
ain’t goin’ foh to have no fool-man like him
dumpin’ me down between dem shaffs what is fit
onny fer a mule! Now yoh heah me? Don’
yoh go foh to pay him nuttin’ fer dis trip!” retorted
Rachel with ire.
</p>
<p>
Natalie laughed unrestrainedly at the funny
scene, but the driver was again crossing the
bridge, leading the balky Cherub, so she managed
to cover her face to hide her amusement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
While Amity tried to tie up the damaged portions
of the harness so that the trip might be
completed, Rachel came over and glared down at
him.
</p>
<p>
“Say, yoh pore mis’able chunk of cotton-haid!
Don’ yoh know I kin kerleck damages f’om yoh
foh whad happened t’ me on dis premises of
yourn?”
</p>
<p>
Amity looked up and returned her glare.
“Say, you old black mammy, don’t you know I
kin make you pay handsome fer smashin’ my
buckboard? Even the harness would have held
if you hadn’t been so heavy as to make Cherub
break away from the load.”
</p>
<p>
That was too much for Rachel. She straightened
up with family pride and planted her hands
on her ample hips as she declared: “See heah,
ig’nant clod-hoppeh! Don’ yoh go an’ fool
yohse’f wid t’inkin’ I’se as easy-goin’ as dat harness
ob yourn—’cus I ain’t! I’m an out-an’-out
Noo Yorker, I am, an’ yoh kin ast Mis’ James!
I made one on dem fresh condoctors in Noo York
pay me fohty dollahs onct, when he started his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
trolley an’ dumped me down flat in th’ road an’
druv away a-laffin at me. An’ I wasn’t damaged
half as much dat time, as you done.”
</p>
<p>
Amity had finished tying up the harness and
was backing Cherub into the shafts as he listened
to this warning. He now half-closed his squinty
eyes and switched the quid of chewing tobacco
from one cheek to the other before he replied to
Rachel. Then he drawled out tantalizingly:
“You big blackberry, you! Puttin’ on such
airs about what you did to car-conductors! But
I ain’t no easy mark like ’em,—see?”
</p>
<p>
Rachel gasped at his insolence and turned to
Mrs. James for succor. Words failed her.
</p>
<p>
“Amity Ketchum,” commanded Mrs. James
sternly, “drive us to our destination without
further delay, or any more words!”
</p>
<p>
This gave Rachel courage to add: “Da’s whad
I say, too! Whad’he wanta bring us all outen
our way, anyway, when we hired him to drive us
t’ Green Hill Fahm, an’ da’s all!”
</p>
<p>
“Ef someone here don’t make her shet up sassin’
me so I’ll dump all your baggidge out an’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
you kin all walk to Green Hill, es far es I care!”
threatened Amity, standing up defiantly and refusing
to get into the buckboard and start on
the way.
</p>
<p>
Natalie turned to see how far the main road
might be, and Mrs. James glanced fearfully at
the number of heavy suit-cases and bags to be
delivered at the farmhouse, but Rachel was the
one to call his dare.
</p>
<p>
“Ef yoh hain’t in dat seat an’ drivin’ dat
bony nag along in jus’ two secunts,—den yoh
go haid-fust down in dat water—unnerstan’
me?” She rolled up her loose sleeves and
showed a pair of powerful arms that looked like
business.
</p>
<p>
Amity was a thin little man, and this Amazon
apparently meant what she said, for she came for
him with dire purpose expressed in her face. So
he jumped into the buckboard and started the
horse across the bridge without waiting for
Rachel to get in.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James rapped him on the shoulder to
stop, and Natalie called to Rachel to hurry and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
get in, but Amity seemed unable to make Cherub
halt and Rachel tossed her head and scorned to
ask the man to let her ride. To Natalie’s coaxings,
she shouted back: “Don’ worry, Honey!
Rachel ain’t goin’ t’ contamerate herse’f by
sittin’ nex’ to sech white trash.”
</p>
<p>
But the road was bad and walking was irksome
for Rachel who was accustomed to stone
walks and trolleys in the city when she felt tired.
She had to jump mud-puddles that reached
across the road, or plough through the sandy
deep when the way ran alongside a sand-pit and
sand lay heavy on the road.
</p>
<p>
Finally Amity drove up the hill that ascended
from the river, and stopped beside the piazza
steps. The driver felt that he had finished
a hard day’s work, and now sat back resting,
allowing the ladies to get down as best they
could.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James took her purse from the hand-bag
to pay for the trip, when Rachel puffed up beside
them. She saw the luggage still in the vehicle,
and turned to order Amity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“Carry dat baggidge t’ th’ doah, yoh lazy-bones!”
</p>
<p>
“I was hired to drive three passengers to
Green Hill. I done it, an’ that’s all I have to
do!” retorted he.
</p>
<p>
“Mis’ James, don’ yoh dare pay him a cent till
he min’s what I tell him,” commanded Rachel,
stern because she was on her own soil at last.
</p>
<p>
Amity remembered he had not been paid, so
he grumblingly transferred the bags from the
buckboard to the steps, then held out his hand
for his payment. “Dollar an’ a half,” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Mis’ James, don’t you go an’ pay him no
moh den one dollah, I tells yoh! He cain’t make
me pay nottin’ cuz he made me walk half th’ way.
Dat don’t stan’ in any United States Co’ht, no-how!”
shrilled Rachel, furiously.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James had opened her purse and hesitated
between two fires—“to pay, or not to
pay” the full price asked.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t fergit my dashboard is smashed, an’
I ain’t sayin’ a word ’bout payin’ fer dat!”
snapped Amity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
“An’ don’ yoh fergit my se’f respeck an’ modesty
what was smashed when yoh made me stan’
on m’ haid in dose shaffs! I shore will git Mr.
Marwin to sue yoh, ef yoh don’t go ’long ’bout
yoh bis’nis!” exclaimed Rachel.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James placed a dollar bill on the front
seat, and turned to Natalie and said: “Open the
side-door, dear, so we can go in.”
</p>
<p>
Amity got up in the buckboard, took the dollar
and drove away without saying another word.
Rachel waited and watched him drive to the
front gate, where he turned to call back to her:
“When you want a job in a circus as a giant
huckleberry, come to me fer references. ‘I’ll
tell th’ worl’’ what a fighter you are!”
</p>
<p>
And Rachel shouted back at him: “Yoh got
th’ fust an’ last cent outen dis fam’ly foh joy-ridin’!
I’m goin’ to start a hack-line an’ put yoh
outen bis’nis, ef I has t’ take all m’ life-insuhance
money to do it, I am. I got a nephew what’ll
be glad t’ he’p me do a good turn to th’ country,
as puttin’ yoh back whar yoh b’long!” Then
she turned to her companions for their approval.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—INVESTIGATING GREEN HILL FARM</h2>
<p>
As Rachel labored breathlessly with the baggage,
she failed to notice any changes in the appearance
of the house or grounds, but Natalie
saw an improvement.
</p>
<p>
“What has been done, Jimmy, to make everything
look so trim and nice?”
</p>
<p>
“I hadn’t really noticed, Natalie, but now that
you draw attention to the fact, I see they have
trimmed the box-hedges along all the paths, and
the grass has been mowed. Even the shade-trees
have been pruned and cleaned out. How well
it looks.”
</p>
<p>
“Laws’ee, Mis’ James! Ef dey hain’t gone
an’ nailed a brass knock on dis doah!” exclaimed
Rachel, dropping her burdens on the mat and
staring up at the quaint old knocker that had
been fastened to the Colonial door since their
last visit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
When the door was thrown open, Natalie had
a glimpse of the inside—now furnished and most
attractive. She followed Mrs. James and
Rachel indoors and clapped her hands in pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“How perfectly lovely, Jimmy! Who would
have dreamed that the dusty old place would
look like this with a few pieces of furniture and
a good clean-up of the rooms.”
</p>
<p>
“I swan!” breathed Rachel, in admiration, as
she noted the braided rag rugs on the hall
floor, the Colonial mirror on the wall, and
the hall-table with drop-leaves flanked on
either side by two straight backed rush-bottom
chairs.
</p>
<p>
“It’s almos’ as fine as dem ole manor houses
in Norf Car’liny. I ust to be nuss-maid in one
on ’em befoh I come Norf,” was her final appraisal
of the inside of the house.
</p>
<p>
Every nook and corner had been scoured until
the entire house smelled of cleanliness. Then
the antique furniture that had been discovered
in the attic had been cleaned and polished until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
no one would have said they were the same old
objects.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Marvin had selected enough braided and
carpet-rag rugs for the floors as would look artistic
without covering up much of the fine old
oak-flooring of great wide boards. Simple cottage
draperies hung at the old-fashioned windows,
and the personal effects belonging to Natalie
were so arranged as to give the entire interior
a homey look. It was a cheerful home for
a forlorn little orphan, and she felt the atmosphere
of the place instantly.
</p>
<p>
Rachel had gone directly to the kitchen after
she left the others in the hall, and now she was
heard exclaiming delightedly: “Oh, Mis’ James—an’
Honey darlin’! Come right out to my
place an’ see how fine I am!”
</p>
<p>
They hurried out through the pantry and were
surprised to find what a great improvement had
been made in the large kitchen, with plenty of
white enamel paint, new porcelain sink and
table, and a fine modern range. Even the chairs
and cupboards were glistening white, and white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
dotted swiss sash curtains hung at the four large
windows.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t it jus’ too gran’ fer anythin’!” giggled
Rachel, as pleased as a child with a new toy.
</p>
<p>
“It certainly is! We will all want to live in
the kitchen, I fear, Rachel,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Who ever straightened up dis house fer us,
suttinly knew her bis’nis!” declared Rachel.
“Jus’ look at my closets—not one thing outen
place. Pans, pots, an’ dishes—jus’ whar I’d ’a’
put them myse’f.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie was too curious to inspect the up-stairs,
now, to remain longer in the kitchen, so she ran
away, followed by Mrs. James. Rachel was too
engrossed with the idea of preparing a luncheon
on the nice kitchen range to bother about up-stairs.
</p>
<p>
On the wide landing of the main stairs Mr.
Marvin had had made a cushioned window-seat,
so that one could sit and look out over the kitchen
gardens and beyond the fields, to the woodland
that bordered the stream at the extreme end of
the farm. Past the woodland on the farther side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
of the river rose a pretty green hill, similar to the
one the house stood upon.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t this view just glorious?” cried Natalie,
as she dropped upon the seat and gazed enrapt
at the scene.
</p>
<p>
After resting for some time in the window-seat,
the young owner sighed and started up the
rest of the stairs to the chamber floor. Here she
inspected the various rooms with the old four-posted
beds and high-boys, then came to a large,
low-ceiled corner-room that had a similar view
as had from the landing, of the side and back sections
of the farm, with the woodland and stream
beyond.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how darling!” cried Natalie, seeing that
all her favorite furnishings were arranged here.
“This must be mine.”
</p>
<p>
“It is, dear. Mr. Marvin said he wanted you
to have the best room with all your beloved objects
around you. Here you can read, or sew,
or plan for your estate,” said Mrs. James smiling
gently at the pleased girl.
</p>
<p>
While Natalie rocked in the comfortable sewing-chair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
that she remembered her mother had
preferred to all others, Rachel was heard coming
to the foot of the stairs. She called authoritatively,
“You-all hurry right down to dis fine
lunch what I got ready! Dat range bakes like
Ole Ned—an’ I got jus’ de fines’ pop-overs you
eveh saw’d!”
</p>
<p>
“Um! That sounds tempting, Jimmy! Let’s
run,” laughed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
While the two sat down at the round mahogany
table that would easily seat ten, Rachel stood
in the pantry door with her hands folded over
her expansive figure. She smiled indulgently
when Mrs. James praised the brown disks of hot
bread just from the oven, and then went back to
the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon was spent in walking about the
farm and planning various wonderful things: the
vegetable gardens; the place where Miss Mason
proposed having her camp for the Girl Scouts;
selecting the best pasture if Mr. Marvin would
consent to their having a cow. Then the out-buildings
had to be examined in order to ascertain if they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
in good enough order to house
a cow, and a pig, and chickens.
</p>
<p>
It was evening before Natalie dreamed it, and
they turned toward the house with appetites that
made them as ravenous as any half-starved
tramp. But Rachel was ready for them, and
Natalie ate a supper such as she had not enjoyed
in years. Mrs. James watched with pleasure,
for the air and change had already worked a
great good in the girl.
</p>
<p>
The sun was setting over the woodland when
Natalie came from the dining-room. She sat
down on the step of the side piazza to admire the
scene, when Mrs. James joined her, carrying two
books.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wondered where those Scout books
were,” remarked Natalie, taking one from her
friend. “Are you going to read yours now?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and I thought you would like to, too.
We can sit and enjoy the cool of the evening,
and discuss anything in the book that you do
not understand.”
</p>
<p>
After reading eagerly for some time, Natalie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
said: “I see here in the section of the book that
is devoted to forming a Patrol or Troop, that
each Patrol has a Leader, and also a Corporal to
assist her. These offices are held through votes
cast by the Scouts, and each one of these officers
holds her position until another election.
</p>
<p>
“But there can be no Patrol until there are
eight girls banded together to form one. How
could we five girls expect to start a unit when
we haven’t enough girls to begin with?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Mason suggested that, after she opens
the camp on the river land, you girls might
attend one of the meetings of her Scouts and, if
you like the work, join her Patrol until you have
enough members with you to branch out and organize
one of your own. This will not only give
you girls a good beginning in the work, but also
help her girls to charter a Troop.”
</p>
<p>
“When will this be, Jimmy, if Miss Mason’s
girls can’t get away before July 1st?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James laughed. “I’m sure I don’t
know, dear. Miss Mason will be better able to
tell us that important point.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, at least I have the book that I can
read and find out what Girl Scouts are supposed
to do. Then I will be able to go right along
when we do join Miss Mason’s girls.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good ambition, Natalie, and let the
future take care of itself. You only have to take
one step at a time, you know, and no human being
ever lives more than one moment at a time.
But how many of us plan for the future and
worry about to-morrow or next week! People
would stop worrying and hoarding if they understood
the only right way to think and live.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie smiled, for she knew Mrs. James desired
to help humanity stop its worries. So she
said nothing but continued her reading of the
Manual. When she reached page 60, Section
VII, and began reading about the tests for Girl
Scouts, she exclaimed: “Oh, now I see what I
can do!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James looked up from her copy and
waited to hear.
</p>
<p>
“I can learn and recite to you the Scout
Promise and the Scout Laws, as is requested in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
this section. I can acquaint myself with the
Scout Salute, and when to use it. I can memorize
the Scout Slogan and the Motto, and learn
how respect to our Flag is expressed. All these
other things I can study and know, so that I can
stand up before Miss Mason’s girls and answer
any questions on this section that are asked
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Natalie, and you can also practice making
knots, as mentioned here; learn the Scout
exercises in every way; become proficient in making
a fire, cook decent food, make a bed properly,
demonstrate your sewing, and all the other
things requested of a Scout for the tests,” added
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
The two readers became so interested in the
books that they failed to notice how dim the
light was growing, until Rachel came to the
side door and exclaimed at seeing them with
noses buried in “Scouting for Girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Laws’ee! Ef dem books tell you-all to spile
yoh eyes like-a-dis, den I ain’t got no use foh
’em. Come right along in, now, and set by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
lamp an’ read—ef yoh gotta finish de hull book
in one night!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James looked up, laughed, and placed
a hand over Natalie’s page. “Rachel is quite
right! Here we are trying to read by twilight
that would forbid anyone with common sense to
attempt such a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve reached a thrilling place in the book,
Jimmy! Can’t I just finish this chapter?”
begged Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, but not out here. Let us go indoors
and use the table-light.”
</p>
<p>
Rachel had gone in and the lights were
switched on, so Natalie ran in to enjoy the engrossing
page.
</p>
<p>
“What is the chapter you are so interested in,
dear?” asked Mrs. James, as they settled down
in cozy comfort to continue their reading.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, this chapter called ‘Woodcraft.’ It is
so wonderful to one who never dreamed of such
things being in the woods!”
</p>
<p>
“My! But you must have read very quickly
to have reached the thirteenth section already.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
I have only read up to the ninth,” returned Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
Natalie laughed. “To tell the truth, Jimmy,
I skipped some of the chapters that looked dry
and educational. I saw the pictures of these
mushrooms, and the little creatures of the wood,
and I glanced at the opening words of the chapter.
After that, I kept right on, and couldn’t
stop.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James smiled and shook her head.
“That is a bad habit to form—skipping things
that <em>seem</em> dry and hard to do.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie heard the gentle rebuke but smiled as
she read the woodcraft chapter to its end. Then,
instead of repenting of the habit of “skipping,”
she turned the pages of the book and read where
she found another interesting chapter. This
happened to be Section XVI on a Girl Scout’s
Garden. She read this part way through and
then had a brilliant idea.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy! Janet Wardell says I ought to
start a vegetable garden at once, and not only
raise enough for us all to live on this summer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
but have some to send to the city to sell to my
friends.”
</p>
<p>
“I spoke to Rachel about that plan, Natalie,
and she is of the same opinion: we really ought
to garden and thus save cost of living.”
</p>
<p>
“You know, Jimmy, that Janet is crazy over
the war-garden she had for two years, and she
told me it was the most fun! Digging and seeding
down the soil, and weeding or harvesting
was as much fun as playing croquet or tennis,—and
a lot more remunerative. But then Janet
always was ambitious. We all say she should
have been a boy instead of a girl—with her go-a-headness.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why a boy should be accredited
with all the ambitions, and energy, or activity of
young folks!” protested Mrs. James. “Girls
are just as able to carry on a successful career as
a boy,—and that is one thing the Girl Scouts
will teach the world in general,—there is no difference
in the Mind, and the ambitions and work
that that Mind produces, whether it be in boy or
girl. So I’m glad Janet is so positive a force
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
with you four girls: she will urge you to accomplish
more than you would, if left to your own
indolent devices.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll grant you that, Jimmy, but let’s talk
about the possibilities of a garden, without losing
any more time. Do you think we might
start in at once? To-morrow, say?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course we can! In fact, I wrote our
next-door neighbor, Mr. Ames, to bring his
plough and horse in the morning and turn
over the soil so we could see what its condition
is.”
</p>
<p>
“Goody! Then I will start right in and raise
vegetables and by the time the girls come down,
I ought to have some greens growing up to show
them!” cried Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James laughed. “I’m not so sure that
seeds will grow so quickly as to show green tops
in two weeks. You must remember that ploughing,
cleaning out stones and old weeds, then
raking and fertilizing the soil, will take several
days. By the time the seeds are planted it will
have taken a week. In ten days more, we shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
have the girls with us. So our vegetables
will be wonders if they pop up in ten days’
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—anyway—I can point out all that has
been done in that time, and explain why the
greens do not show themselves,” argued Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James nodded, smilingly, to keep Natalie’s
ambition alive. It was the first time in all
the time she had known the girl that she had
found her eagerly planning anything that was
really constructive and beneficial to everyone.
And especially would it prove beneficial to herself,
for working in the open air, and digging in
the ground, would be the best tonics she could
have. And the slender, undersized, morbid girl
needed just such tonic.
</p>
<p>
So Mrs. James laid aside her book and devoted
the rest of the evening to the plans for a fine
truck garden.
</p>
<p>
In half an hour the two had sketched a rough
diagram for the garden, following the picture
given in the Scout book. “All around the outside of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
the rows of vegetables, I want to plant
flowers, so it will be artistic as well as useful,”
said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“If I were you, dear, I’d stick to the vegetables
in the large garden, and plant flowers in
the roundel and small beds about the house,
where the color and perfume will reach us as we
sit indoors or on the piazzas,” suggested Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“But the vegetable garden will look so plain
and ugly with nothing but bean poles and brush
for peas,” complained Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Not so, Natalie. When the blossoms on the
bean-vines wave in the breeze, and the gorgeous
orange flowers bloom on the pumpkin and melon
vines, or the peas send you their sweet scent, you
will be glad you did as I suggest. Besides, we
will need so many flowers about the house that it
will take all the time and money we have to spare
to take care of those beds.”
</p>
<p>
So Natalie was persuaded to try out Mrs.
James’ ideas.
</p>
<p>
“How long will it take us to get the seeds to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
plant in our vegetable garden, Jimmy?” asked
she later.
</p>
<p>
“I can telephone my order in to the seed store
in the morning, and they can mail the package
at once. We ought to have it in two days, at
least,” answered Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“That will be time enough, won’t it? Because
we have to plough and rake the beds first. Oh,
I do hope that farmer won’t forget to come in
the morning,” sighed Natalie, running to the
door to look out at the night sky and see if there
was any indication of rain for the morrow.
</p>
<p>
“The sky is clear and the stars are shining like
beacons,” exclaimed she, turning to Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
That lady smiled for she understood why
Natalie had gone to investigate the weather signals.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we ought to go to bed early, Natalie,
so we can be up when Farmer Ames arrives,”
hinted she.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what time do you think he will be
here?”
</p>
<p>
“Farmers generally begin work at five, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
he may not arrive until after his chores are attended
to. I suppose we may look for him about
seven o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Seven o’clock! Mercy, Jimmy, we won’t be
awake then,” cried Natalie, surprised at such
hours.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, we will, because everyone in the
country goes to bed at nine and rises at five. We
must begin the same habit.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! How outlandish! Why, we never
<em>think</em> of bed in the city until eleven,—and later if
we go to the theatre, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s why everyone has pasty complexions
and has to resort to rouge. If folks would keep
decent hours they’d be healthier and deprive the
doctors and druggists of an income. We will
begin to live in the country as country people do,
and then we will show city folks what we gain
by such living,” replied Mrs. James, mildly but
firmly.
</p>
<p>
So they prepared to retire that first night on
Green Hill Farm, when the hands on the old
grandfather’s clock pointed to eight-forty-five.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
Even Rachel laughed as she started up-stairs
back of her young mistress, and after saying
good-night, added: “Ef I onny could grow roses
in m’ cheeks like-as-how you-all kin! But dey
woulden show, nohow, on my black face!”
</p>
<p>
She laughed heartily at her joke and went to
the small room over the kitchen, still shaking
with laughter.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—NATALIE BEGINS HER PLANTING</h2>
<p>
The singing of the birds, nested in the old red
maple tree that overshadowed the house on the
side where Natalie’s room was, roused her from
the most restful sleep she had had in months.
No vibration of electricity such as one constantly
hears and feels in the city, no shouting of folks
in the streets, no milkman with his reckless banging
of cans, no steamboat’s shrieks and wails such
as one hears when living on the Drive, disturbed
the peace and quietude of the night in the
country.
</p>
<p>
“Oh my! I hope I haven’t overslept,”
thought Natalie, as she sat up, wide awake. She
looked at the clock on the table and could
scarcely believe it was but five minutes of five.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it feels like eight to me!” she said to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
herself, as she sprang from bed and ran to sniff
the delightful fresh air that gently waved the
curtains in and out of the opened windows.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to surprise Jimmy! I’ll be
dressed and out in the garden before she wakes
up,” giggled the girl, hastily catching up her
bath-towel and soap, and running stealthily
along the hall to the bathroom.
</p>
<p>
But her plans were not realized, because Mrs.
James was up and down-stairs before Natalie
ever heard the birds sing. She sat on the piazza
sorting some bulbs and roots she had brought
from the city in her trunk.
</p>
<p>
After Natalie was dressed, she tiptoed to
Mrs. James’ door and turned the knob very
quietly so the sleeper should not awake. But
she found the bed empty and the room vacated.
</p>
<p>
Down-stairs she flew, and saw the side door
open. She also got a whiff of muffins, and knew
Rachel was up and preparing an early breakfast.
Out of the door she went, and stood still when
she found Mrs. James working on queer-looking
roots.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
“When did you get up?” asked she, taken
aback.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, about quarter to five. When did you?”
laughed Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I woke ten minutes later, but I wanted to
s’prise you in bed. I went in and found the room
empty,” explained Natalie. “What sort of
vegetables are those roots?”
</p>
<p>
“These are dahlia roots, and they will look
fine at the fence-line, over there, that divides the
field from our driveway. Do you see these dried
sticks that come from each root? Those are last
year’s plant-stalks. We leave them on during the
winter months, so the roots won’t sprout until
you plant them. Now I will cut them down
quite close to the root before I put them in the
ground.”
</p>
<p>
As she spoke, Mrs. James trimmed down
the old stalks to within an inch of the root,
then gathered up her apronful of bulbs
and roots and stood ready to go down the
steps.
</p>
<p>
“Do you wish to help, Natty? You can bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
the spade and digging fork that Rachel placed
outside the cellar door for me.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie ran for the tools and hurried after
Mrs. James to the narrow flower bed that ran
alongside the picket fence. A ten-inch grass-border
separated this flower bed from the side
door driveway, making the place for flowers quite
secure from wheeltracks or unwary horses’ hoofs.
</p>
<p>
The dahlia roots were planted so that the tip
edge of the old stalks barely showed above the
soil. Then the bulbs were planted: lily bulbs,
Egyptian iris, Nile Grass, and other plants
which will come up every year after once being
planted.
</p>
<p>
“There now! That is done and they are on
the road to beautifying our grounds,” sighed
Mrs. James, standing up and stretching her arm
muscles.
</p>
<p>
“After all I’ve said, you were the first one to
plant, anyway,” complained Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Not in the vegetable garden! And flowers
are not much account when one has to eat and
live,” laughed Mrs. James.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
A voice calling from the kitchen door, now
diverted attention from the roots and bulbs. “I
got dem muffins on de table an’ nice cereal ready
to dish up,” announced Rachel.
</p>
<p>
“And we’re ready for it, too!” declared Natalie.
</p>
<p>
During the morning meal, Mrs. James and
her protégée talked of nothing but gardening,
and the prospects of an early crop. To anyone
experienced in farming, their confidence in harvesting
vegetables within a fortnight would have
been highly amusing. But no one was present to
reflect as much as a smile on their ardor, so the
planning went on.
</p>
<p>
It was not quite seven when Farmer Ames
drove in at the side gate and passed the house.
Natalie ran out to greet him and to make
sure he had brought the plough in the farm
wagon.
</p>
<p>
“Good-morning, Mr. Ames. How long will
it be before you start the ploughing?” called
Natalie, as the horse was stopped opposite the
side door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
“Good-mornin’, miss. Is Mis’ James to home
this mornin’?” asked the be-whiskered farmer,
nodding an acknowledgment of Natalie’s greeting.
</p>
<p>
“Here I am, Mr. Ames. Both of us are ready
to help in the gardening in whatever way you
suggest,” said Mrs. James, appearing on the
porch.
</p>
<p>
“Thar ain’t much to be helped, yit, but soon’s
I git Bob ploughin’, you’se kin go over the sile
and pick out any big stones that might turn up.
Ef they ain’t taken out they will spile the
growin’ of the plants by keepin’ out light and
heat.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie exchanged looks with her companion.
Neither one had ever thought of such a possibility.
</p>
<p>
“What shall I use for them—a rake?” asked
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Rake—Nuthin’! all its teeth would crack
off ef you tried to drag a big rock with it. Nop—one
has to use plain old hands to pick up rocks
and carry them to the side of the field.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we’d better wear gloves, Jimmy,”
suggested Natalie in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed! I’m glad we brought some
rubber gloves with us in case of need in the
house. I never dreamed of using them for this,”
returned Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
She turned and went indoors for the gloves
while Farmer Ames drove on to the barns.
Natalie followed the wagon, because she felt she
could not afford to lose a moment away from this
valuable ally in the new plan of work.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ames, as soon as our garden is
ploughed, can it be seeded?” asked she, when the
farmer began to unhitch the horse.
</p>
<p>
“That depends. Ef your sile is rich and fertile,
then you’se kin plant as soon as it is smoothed
out. First the rocks must come out, then the
ground is broken up fine, and last you must rake,
over and over, until the earth is smooth as a
table.”
</p>
<p>
“What plants ought I to choose first? You
see it is so late in the season, I fear my garden
will be backward,” said Natalie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nah—don’t worry ’bout that, sis,” remarked
the farmer. “Becus we had a cold wet spring
and the ground never got warm enough fer seeds
until ten days ago. Why, I diden even waste
my time and money tryin’ out any seeds till last
week. I will gain more in the end because the
sun-rays are warm enough this month to show
results in my planting. Ef I hed seeded all my
vegetables in that cold spell in May they would
hev laid dormant and, mebbe, rotted. So you
don’t need to worry about its bein’ late this year.
Some years that is true—we kin seed in early
May, but not this time.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m so glad for that! Now I can race with
other farmers around here and see who gets the
best crops,” laughed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“What’cha goin’ to plant down?” asked Mr.
Ames, curious to hear how this city girl would
begin.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I was going to leave that to your judgment,”
returned she naïvely.
</p>
<p>
“Ha, ha, ha!” was the farmer’s return to this
answer. Then he added: “Wall now, I kin give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
you some young tomater plants and cabbiges an’
cauliflower slips. Them is allus hard to seed so
I plants mine in a hot-bed in winter and raises
enough to sell to the countryside fer plantin’ in
the spring. I got some few dozen left what you
are welcome to, ef you want ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, fine! I certainly do want them,” exclaimed
Natalie. “Can I go to your house, now,
and get them?”
</p>
<p>
“Better leave ’em planted ’til you wants to
put ’em in your garden. They will wilt away ef
you leave ’em out of sile fer a day er night. Besides,
this stonin’ work will keep you busy to-day.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James now joined them, and handed
Natalie a pair of rubber gloves. Farmer Ames
stared at them in surprise for he had never seen
anyone wear gloves while gardening—at least,
not in Greenville.
</p>
<p>
As he drove Bob and the plough to the garden-space,
Natalie and Mrs. James followed, talking
eagerly of the plants promised them by the
farmer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ames, you forgot to tell me what seeds
to plant first?” Natalie reminded him, as he
rolled up his shirt sleeves, preparatory to steering
the plough.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that is a matter of chice. Some likes
to seed their radishes fust, an’ some get their
lettuce in fust. Now I does it this way: lettuce
grows so mighty fast that I figgers I lose time
ef I put it down fust and let the other vegetables
wait. So I drops in my beets, radishes, beans,
peas, and sech like, an’ last of all I gets in the
lettuce seed. I gen’ally uses my early plants
from the hot-bed fer the fust crop in my truck-garden.
I got some little beet plants, and a
handful of radish plants what was weeded out
of the over-crowded beds, that you may as well
use now, and seed down the others you want.
My man is going over all the beds to-day, and I
will hev him save what you kin use in your
garden.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how good you are! I never knew
strangers in the country would act like your own
family!” exclaimed Natalie. “In the city
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
everyone thinks of getting the most out of you
for what they have, that you might need.”
</p>
<p>
Both the adults laughed at this precocious denunciation
of city dealers. Old Bob now began
to plod along the edge of the garden-space with
his master behind guiding the plough. Natalie
walked beside the farmer and watched eagerly
as the soil curled over and over when the blade
of the plough cut it through and pushed it upwards.
</p>
<p>
Farmer Ames was feeling quite at home, now
that he was working the ground, and he began
to converse freely with his young companion.
</p>
<p>
“Yeh know, don’cha, thet the man what lived
here fer ten years, er more, was what we call a
gentleman farmer. He went at things after the
rules given in some books from the Agricultural
Department from Washerton, D. C. He even
hed a feller come out from thar and make a test
of the sile. The upshot of it all was, he got a
pile of stuff from Noo York—powders, fertilizers,
and such, an’ doctored the hull farm until
we gaped at him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, we all hed to confess that he raised the
finest pertaters, and corn, and other truck of
anyone fer many a mile around. I allus did say
I’d foller his example, but somehow, thar’s so
much work waitin’ to be done on a farm, that one
never gits time to sit down to writin’. So I postponed
it every year.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, this is awfully interesting, Mr. Ames.
I never knew who the tenant was, but he must
have had a good sensible education on how to
run a farm, or he wouldn’t have known about
these fertilizers.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeh, we-all ust to grin at him for fuddling
about on the sile before he’d seed anythin’—but
golly! he got crops like-as-how we never saw
raised before.”
</p>
<p>
“I could try the same methods,” said Natalie
musingly.
</p>
<p>
“He worked over the sile every year, and
never planted the same crops in the same
places. He called it a sort of rotary process,
and he tol’ me my crops would double ef I did
it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did he mix in the doctorings every year,
too?” asked Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Sure! That’s why he sent little boxes of dirt
to Washerton—to find out just what to use in
certain qualities of sile.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I ought to do it, too, hadn’t I?” asked
she.
</p>
<p>
“Not this year, ’cause he said the last year he
did it, that now he could skip a year or two. But
you’ve gotta mix in good fertilizer before you
plant. Then you’se kin laff at all us old fogy
farmers what stick to old-fashioned ways.”
</p>
<p>
Farmer Ames laughed heartily as if to encourage
his young student, and to show how she
might laugh after harvesting. Natalie gazed at
him with a fascinated manner, for his lower lip
had such a peculiar way of being sucked in under
his upper teeth when he laughed. Not until
Mrs. James explained this, by saying that
Farmer Ames had no lower teeth, did she lose
interest in this mannerism.
</p>
<p>
“I know all about the tools a farmer has to
use in his work, Mr. Ames,” bragged Natalie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do yeh? Wall then, you kin get the
rake and hoe, and fix up the sile where the
plough is done turned it up.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie remembered the paragraph in “Scouting
for Girls” and asked: “Shall I bring the
spade, too?”
</p>
<p>
Just then, Mr. Ames stubbed his toe against
a large stone that had been turned out of its bed.
He grumbled forth: “Better git a pickaxe and
crowbar.”
</p>
<p>
“My book didn’t mention crowbars and pickaxes,
Mr. Ames, so I don’t know what they are,”
ventured Natalie modestly.
</p>
<p>
“Every farmer has to have a pick and crow
on hand in case he wants to dig fence-post holes,
er move a rock—like the one I just hit.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! But our fences are all made.”
</p>
<p>
“So are the rocks! But they ain’t moved.
Better go over the ploughed dirt and find ’em,
then git them outen the garden.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie began to hunt for stones, and as she
found any, to carry them over to the fence where
she threw them over in the adjoining field. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
was not very exciting pastime, and her back began
to ache horribly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James, who had lingered behind, now
joined Natalie and exclaimed in surprise, “Why,
I thought you said the old tenant was so particular
with his garden? He should have removed
all these stones, then.”
</p>
<p>
“This section was used fer pertaters an’ corn
every other year, an’ some stones is good to drain
the sile fer them sort of greens. But fer small
truck like you’se plan to plant here, the stones
has to get out.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James assisted Natalie in throwing out
stones which turned up under the plough-blade,
and when that section of the garden was finished,
Mr. Ames mopped his warm brow and looked
back over his work with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“Ef you’se want to plant corn over in that unused
spot alongside the field, it will be a fine
place to use. It is not been used fer years fer
truck.”
</p>
<p>
“It looks awfully weedy. Maybe things
won’t grow there,” ventured Natalie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hoh, them’s only top-weeds what can be
yanked out. The sile itself is good as any hereabouts.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, Mr. Ames,” said Mrs. James,
“you’d better plough that section, too, for the
corn or potatoes.”
</p>
<p>
So the rough part of the ground by the fence-line
was ploughed up, but the quantity of stones
found in the soil was appalling to Natalie. Mr.
Ames chuckled at her expression.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry about seein’ so many, ’cuz you
only has to pick out one stone at a time, you
know. Ef you does this one at a time, widdout
thinkin’ of how many there seem to be afore your
eyes, you soon git them all out an’ away.”
</p>
<p>
“I see Mr. Ames is a good moralizer,” smiled
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
He nodded his head, and then suggested that
he visit the barnyard to see if any old compost
was left about by the former tenant. If so, it
would be a good time to dig it under in the
ploughed soil.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I want to go with Mr. Ames, Jimmy, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
see just what compost he considers good,” exclaimed
Natalie, dancing away.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James watched her go and smiled. The
tonic of being in the country and working on the
farm was beginning to tell already. Before she
resumed her task of picking up stones, however,
the clarion voice of Rachel came from the kitchen
porch.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, Mis’ James! I’se got lunch all ready
to eat!”
</p>
<p>
As the lady was well-nigh starved because of
the early breakfast and the work in the earth, she
sighed in relief. Now she would have a spell in
which to rest and gain courage to go on with the
stoning. This showed that it was not interesting
to Mrs. James, but she was determined to carry
it through.
</p>
<p>
Natalie ran indoors soon after Mrs. James and
went to the dining-room where the luncheon was
served. She was so eager to tell what Farmer
Ames told her that she hardly saw that Rachel
had prepared her favorite dessert—berry tarts.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy, Mr. Ames knows more about farming and soil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
than books! He says a mixed compost
from the stables and barnyard makes the
best of all fertilizers.”
</p>
<p>
“His logic sounds plausible, Natty, but we
haven’t any such compost to use, and perhaps
never will have if we wish to use it from our own
barns,” said Mrs. James regretfully.
</p>
<p>
“But Mr. Ames said he could sell us some of
that grade compost, if we needed any. He says
he does not believe our soil needs fertilizing this
year, as it is so rich already.”
</p>
<p>
“That is splendid news, as it will save us much
time in seeding, too,” returned Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I wanted to show him that I knew something
about composts, so I told him about what I read
in the book for Scouts last night:—that one could
use a commercial fertilizer if one had no barnyard
manure available. He looked at me
amazed, and I explained that many farmers used
four-parts bone-dust to one part muriate of potash
and mixed it well. This would fertilize a
square rod of land. I felt awfully proud of myself
as I spoke, but he soon made me feel humble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
again, by saying, ‘Do you spread it out on top
of the ground after the seed is in, Miss Natalie,
or do you put it under the sile to het up the
roots?’”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James laughed and asked, “What could
you say?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just it—I didn’t know, Jimmy; so I
made a guess at it. I replied: ‘Why, I mix it
very carefully all through the soil’—and Jimmy!
I struck it right first time!” laughed she.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames had finished his dinner (so he called
it) long before Natalie and her chaperone, and
when they started to leave the house they found
that he was hard at work removing the rest of the
stones from the ploughed ground.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so glad of that, Jimmy!” cried Natalie,
as she watched the farmer at work.
</p>
<p>
“Well, to tell the truth, Natalie, I’m not sorry
to find that job taken from us,” laughed Mrs.
James. “I found it most tiresome and with no
encouragement from the stones.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s do something else, Jimmy, and let Mr.
Ames finish the stone-work,” suggested Natalie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
quickly. Just then Rachel came out on the back
steps of the kitchen porch.
</p>
<p>
“Mis’ James, Farmeh Ames say foh you-all
to drive ole Bob back to his house en’ fetch a load
of compos’ what he says is back of his barns. His
man knows about it. Den you kin brung along
dem leetle plants what is weeded out of his garden
and keep ’em down cellar fer to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie felt elated at this novel suggestion of
work, thereby freeing them both from the irksome
task of stoning the garden. And Mrs.
James laughed as she pictured herself driving
the farm-wagon on the county road where an
endless stream of automobiles constantly passed.
</p>
<p>
But she was courageous, and soon the two
were gayly chattering, as Bob stumbled and
stamped along the macadam road. Above the
clatter of loose wheels and rattling boards in the
floor of the old wagon, the merry laughter of
Natalie could be heard by the autoists, as they
passed the “turn-out” from Green Hill Farm.
</p>
<p>
Having reached the Ames’s farm and found
the handy-man who would load up the barnyard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
compost in the wagon for them, Natalie asked
him many questions that had been interesting
her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—NATALIE LEARNS SEVERAL SECRETS</h2>
<p>
Natalie made good use of her eyes while
Farmer Ames’s man gave her the vegetable
slips, and when she got back home the first
question she asked Mr. Ames was: “Why can’t
I buy a few of your asparagus slips? I love asparagus
and you have a fine bed of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d give yer some slips, and welcome, but it
don’t grow that way,” replied he. “First you’ve
got to hev jest the right quality of sand and
loam mixed in kerrect proportions, and then yer
seed it down. The fust season of asparagrass it
ain’t no good fer cuttin’; the secunt year it turns
out a few baby stalks, but the third year it comes
along with a fine crop—ef you’ve taken good
care of it through the winter cold, and shaded
the young plants from summer’s sun-heat the
fust two years.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I never dreamed there was so much
trouble to just raising asparagus!” exclaimed
Natalie. “How long does it take in the spring,
Mr. Ames, before the plant produces the ripe
vegetable?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames turned and stared at Natalie to see
if she was joking, but finding she was really in
earnest, he laughingly replied: “Asparagrass
doesn’t ripen like termaters er beans,—when the
young stalk shoots up from the sile, yer cut it
off. It is the tip that is best, fer that holds the
heart of the plant. Ef you let it keep on growin’
it will shoot up into a high plant with the seed in
its cup. But we cut it before it grows up.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear! Then I can’t raise it for three
years, can I?” said she complainingly.
</p>
<p>
“It don’t look that way,” remarked the
farmer.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James and Natalie had returned with the
farm-wagon loaded with compost late in the
afternoon, and Farmer Ames stopped work soon
after their return to Green Hill Farm.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve gotta look after my own stock and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
truck now, but I’ll be back to-morrer mornin’ an’
help spread out the fertilizer so’s the ground will
be ready in another day er two.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what we would have done without
you, Mr. Ames,” said Natalie, standing on
the carriage step near the side drive.
</p>
<p>
“Well, es long es you diden have to do without
me, what’s the use tryin’ to figger out what
you would have done,” laughed he, as he gathered
up the reins.
</p>
<p>
“That’s splendid logic, Mr. Ames,” laughed
Mrs. James, pleased at his reply.
</p>
<p>
“I allus says we waste more time crossin’
bridges what never was excep’ in our imagination,
than it would take to go miles round-about
’em.”
</p>
<p>
After this last original proverb, he started the
horse along his way.
</p>
<p>
Directly after the evening meal, Mrs. James
took her Scout manual and sat down on the
piazza to study the chapter on gardening. Natalie
saw what she was doing and ran in to get
her book, also.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy, it doesn’t say one ought to have a
trowel and pick for garden work. Mr. Ames
said we should always have them on hand in case
of need. I can see how much easier it would have
been to clear the ground of the stones had we had
the pick instead of having had to use the digging-fork,”
said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I think so, too. And the hand-trowel will be
very useful when we transplant the small plants.
I don’t see how one can get along well without it,
or without a short hand-rake. But I wanted
to read what it says about making the garden
beds. That is why I began reading it to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“It says the bed should be three feet wide by
twelve long,” read Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I see; but I have found three feet of
soil to be uncomfortably wide to reach over when
you wish to weed or dig about the plants. If the
vegetables are bush-beans it is almost impossible
to work in the middle of the bed without rubbing
against the outside plants and breaking off
branches. I should certainly plan to have my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
gardens but two feet wide, with a foot-path fifteen
inches wide between every bed.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, where land is limited and costly,
one cannot afford a wide foot-path; but we can,
and it will make the weeding much easier. A ten
or twelve-inch foot-path is almost too narrow to
move about on without damaging the plants
along its edge.”
</p>
<p>
“Is our garden composed of clay, Jimmy, like
it says in the next paragraph?” asked Natalie
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no! Let me read what it says: ‘The bed
should be dug out to a depth of two feet, and if
the soil is clay, six inches deeper than two feet.
In the latter case you will have to fill in the bottom
with broken stones, or cinders, or gravel, for
good drainage. The best soil is a mixture of one-half
sandy loam, one-fourth leaf-mould, or muck
that has been exposed all winter (to rot for this
purpose), and then mix this thoroughly before
filling it in the beds. Sprinkle wood-ashes over
the beds next, and rake them well in the ground
before you plant anything. This is to sweeten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
the soil. Lime may be used for the same purpose;
but in either case, get advice as to the
amount needed for the soil in question.’
</p>
<p>
“That is plain enough. The soil on different
farms differs as much as the people do, so that
a careful analysis is needed to produce good
crops,” explained Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose there are soils that need next to
no potash, and other soil that needs no ashes, or
other chemical treatments,” ventured Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly! So you see, if one added an extra
chemical where enough of such was already in
evidence, it would injure the tender plant as it
sprouted,” added Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy, Mr. Ames told me to-day that good
old leaf-mould was the finest of <em>all</em> composts.
But where can we get any, now?” asked Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I have no doubt we can find enough down
on the river banks to cover your garden beds this
year. Then in the fall we can rake up the leaves
and allow them to rot through the winter for
next season,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot all about the woodland down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
by the stream! I’ll run down there in the morning
to see if I can find any rotted leaves,” said
Natalie eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Natalie, you should also hunt up some long
boards in the barn, or cellar, to use when we
plant the seeds,” advised Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Boards—what for?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if we have the soil all smooth and fine
for planting, our feet will trample down the
ground wherever we walk. We must do our
seeding by leaning over the bed and work down
from each side of the two-foot wide space. By
placing a board on the foot-path between the
beds, we can stand on it and keep the soil from
becoming packed.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think it would do the path good to
be packed down good and hard.”
</p>
<p>
“So it will, but the board will do that in an
even manner. Our shoes will cut in and cause
the packing to be done in an uneven way,” explained
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose we will have to fill some baskets
with any leaf-mould we may find in the woodland. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
how can we carry them up to the
gardens?” Natalie now said.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Mr. Ames can suggest a way to
do that better than our carrying the heavy
loads.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’d willingly carry it, just to have the
benefit of it on my garden. The vegetables will
grow like anything,—Mr. Ames says they will,”
responded Natalie.
</p>
<p>
After a few moments of silence, she turned
again to Mrs. James and asked: “Why did you
just say that we might rake up the leaves in the
fall and put them aside for the winter? Don’t
you know we won’t be here when the leaves
fall?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not so sure of that, Natalie,” returned
Mrs. James. “I have been thinking matters out
very carefully, and from present indications
there will be a great scarcity of apartments, or
rooms, to be had in New York this year. The
rents will be outrageous for us to pay, and as
long as we are so comfortably housed here, why
try to earn the necessary income for high rents?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
The distance to the station is not long, and you
can easily commute to the city to attend school
in September. When winter weather really sets
in, we can take a trunk and board in New York
until spring. That will overcome all financial
worries about leases and rents.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I never thought of that! But the girls
wouldn’t stay with me after September, I’m
afraid,” exclaimed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“We won’t have to plan or worry about that
now,” laughed Mrs. James. “Maybe the girls
will be so much in love with farm-life, they will
beg their parents to permit them to remain
longer than September! In that case, you will
have no loneliness, I’m sure.”
</p>
<p>
“No, that’s so; and I suppose it is really up
to me to make them so happy here that they will
<em>want</em> to remain,” admitted Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t suggested this possibility to Mr.
Marvin, as yet, but I know he will be tremendously
relieved to hear of it, as he is wondering
what can be done in the fall, with our income so
limited.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s talk about it the first time he
comes out to see us. I am perfectly contented
to remain here, if it is best for all.”
</p>
<p>
After this digression, both amateur farmers
turned their attention to the scouting manual
again.
</p>
<p>
“It states here, Jimmy, that one must be careful
not to allow the garden soil to run over
boundaries, and spread out upon the foot-paths.
This can be avoided by using a low length of
fence made of a thin board about six inches high,
or the beds can be walled in with field-stone
which looks very artistic as well as useful. The
plan of walling in the beds also helps to retain
the moisture in the ground where the roots can
drink it as needed.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll make a note of that, Natalie, as it sounds
practical,” said Mrs. James, writing down the
idea on a paper.
</p>
<p>
“And it also suggests that the garden beds
be built up from the pathway for about two or
three inches, making a tiny terrace of each bed
and sinking the foot-path below the bed. By so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
doing, any excessive moisture is drained out from
the soil, so the roots are not kept too wet,” read
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I knew that before, and we certainly
will follow that suggestion when we spread out
our beds.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, when we get as far as that in the work,
our seeds ought to arrive,” remarked Natalie,
yawning behind her hand.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James smiled at the yawn for it was
not yet eight o’clock, and the previous evening
Natalie had grumbled about retiring as
early as nine. But she said nothing about the
yawn.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t hold up the delivery of the seeds on
the ground that we must finish all the garden
beds first,” laughed the lady.
</p>
<p>
“Mercy no! I am as anxious to see the seeds
as I am to plant the tiny green shoots that Mr.
Ames promised to give us.” Then after another
mighty yawn that almost dislocated her
jaw, Natalie added: “Jimmy, I want to get up
very early in the morning to plant those slips we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
got to-day. Mr. Ames says I must give them
several hours in the ground before the sun is up,
so they won’t wilt and die. So I think I will go
up to bed—if you don’t mind?”
</p>
<p>
“By all means, Natalie. And I will follow,
shortly. I just want to enter a few notes on our
work in this diary, then I will retire, also; I think
we can work better at dawn if we get our full
quota of sleep during the night.”
</p>
<p>
The next day was given to breaking up the
clods of earth and raking out the smaller stones
to clear the garden beds. The compost was well-mixed
with the soil by Farmer Ames, while Mrs.
James and Natalie went down to the woodland
by the river and found certain places where leaf-mould
was plentiful. It was as fine as gunpowder,
and of an exceptionally rich quality.
That morning, Mr. Ames had arrived, driving
Bob and an old buckboard. When it was proposed
that someone go for the leaf-mould, Natalie
instantly suggested that they drive Bob to
the woodland so the baskets could be placed on
the buckboard and carried to the garden that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
way. This would save time and great exertion
on the part of someone to carry them from the
river to the beds.
</p>
<p>
Now the containers were lifted up and placed
securely on the back and front platforms of the
buckboard and the two hard-working companions
gladly sat down on the seat and started Bob
up the grass-grown road.
</p>
<p>
Soon they were helping to spread out the leaf-mould
on the soil, and while they worked, Natalie
asked: “Mr. Ames, how comes it that no one
ever went to the river bank to get this rich
mould?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that woodland and the river banks belongs
to this farm, so no one else would trespass
on it. And the man who ran this farm had idees
of his own about fertilizer. He placed no faith
in Nature’s work, but kep’ on buyin’ and experimentin’
with stuff what came from Noo
York.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames stood up while delivering this explanation,
then he added, winking wisely at
Natalie:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
“But he diden spile yer farm, fer all his foolin’
wid Noo York stuff instead of goin’ to Nature
fer her goods.”
</p>
<p>
His hearers laughed and Mrs. James remarked:
“No, I should say not. And you said
yourself that he managed to get the best results
of any farmer round here.”
</p>
<p>
When the leaf-mould was well spread over
three garden beds, Mr. Ames made a suggestion.
</p>
<p>
“Now you two women-folk kin use my tape-line
to measure off three beds as wide as yuh
want ’em, whiles I goes down to the woods with
Bob and brings up some more mould fer the
other beds. When the marking is done, you kin
begin to plant them termater plants I brought
this mornin’. I left ’em in the cellar whar it was
cool and damp.”
</p>
<p>
This was encouraging, for it began to sound as
if the garden was really a fact. Before the seeds
or slips were in the ground, something might
happen to change the plan, thought Natalie. So
Mrs. James and she eagerly measured out the
first few beds, and about the time Mr. Ames was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
ready to drive up his installment of leaf-mould,
they were ready to get the cabbage and tomato
plants.
</p>
<p>
Before sundown that day, three beds were on
the way to producing their vegetables. One bed
was planted with tomatoes and one with cabbages,
the third was used for beets and radishes—plants
which had been kept in the cellar from
the evening before.
</p>
<p>
“To-morrer we will git the other beds done
and you’se kin seed ’em down wid all you’se
wants to raise,” said Mr. Ames, as he mounted
the old buckboard and prepared to drive home.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Ames!” called Natalie anxiously.
“Do you have anyone who drives to the Corners
to-night, or in the morning, so they might get our
seeds from the mail?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m goin’ in m’se’f t’-night. Yeh see, Si
Tompkins has sort of a country-club meetin’ at
his store every week on this night, an’ I hain’t
never missed one!” bragged Farmer Ames.
</p>
<p>
“What do you do at the meetings?” asked
Natalie wonderingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mos’ everything. Lately it has be’n all
about the damp cold season, an’ how we are goin’
to get our truck goin’ ef this weather keeps up.
Some of th’ farmers exchange advice on matters.
Then when the weather ain’t bad, we talks about
polerticks. That old League of Nations kept us
fuming fer th’ longest time! But now that it’s
dead, we let it bury itself.”
</p>
<p>
Both Natalie and Mrs. James laughed appreciatively
at his explanation, and the former
added: “Well, if you will only bring our seeds,
if they have arrived, I won’t dispute your rights
to argue on politics.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will, and gladly,” returned the farmer
as he drove away.
</p>
<p>
Natalie turned to Mrs. James and asked whimsically:
“Did Mr. Ames mean he would gladly
argue politics with us, or gladly bring the seeds
back?”
</p>
<p>
“He meant both, I’m sure,” laughed Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
But he did not appear again that evening, and
Natalie wondered why not. Mrs. James laughingly replied:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
“Because he, most likely, is
the speaker for the night’s meeting at the
store.”
</p>
<p>
Although this was said jokingly, it was exactly
what occurred and detained the farmer
from driving home until after ten. As the farm-house
was dark at that time, he decided to take
the package of seeds home and deliver them in
the morning when he put in his appearance for
work.
</p>
<p>
The farmerettes were ready for him, when he
finally drove in at the side gate. Natalie
watched eagerly as he got out of the vehicle—she
wondered if he had the seeds.
</p>
<p>
“I got th’ seeds, ladies, but I be’n thinkin’
about them pertater seeds what my brother told
me about las’ night when we druv home from
Tompkins’ Corners. Yuh hain’t got no pertaters
figgered on yet, have yeh?”
</p>
<p>
“Laws no! I forgot all about potatoes,” exclaimed
Natalie, using Rachel’s favorite exclamation
when amazed.
</p>
<p>
“Well—no harm done,” returned Mr. Ames.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
“My brother has a reputation fer growin’ th’
best pertater seed in the state, an’ he says he kin
spare yuh about a peck, ef yuh let him know at
once. I allus gits mine of him, an’ my crops
never fail.”
</p>
<p>
“A peck! Why, Mr. Ames—a peck of seed
will plant that whole field!” cried Natalie, nodding
to the big buckwheat field that adjoined her
farm.
</p>
<p>
It was the farmer’s turn to look amazed now.
He glanced from the speaker to Mrs. James and
back again. Mrs. James laughed and said:
“Did you think potato seed looked like our other
seeds?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,—doesn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
Then Farmer Ames threw back his head and
gave vent to a loud guffaw. His Adam’s apple
jumped up and down in his throat as he gasped
for breath, and his under lip came near being
drawn out of sight in the suction caused by his
gasp.
</p>
<p>
“Wall, ef that don’t beat the Irish!” exclaimed
he, when he could speak again. “Mebbe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
we’ll have a few other surprises to give Miss
Natalie afore she is done farmin’.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t a doubt of it!” retorted she. “But
just now you might explain about potato seed.”
</p>
<p>
“How much seed would you have ordered for
a patch of ground about six beds’ size?” asked
Mr. Ames instead of answering her request.
</p>
<p>
“About a pint,—maybe half a pint would be
enough.”
</p>
<p>
Rachel had heard the farmer’s loud laughter
and having learned the cause of it, she decided
to spare her little mistress any further
ridicule. So she got an old potato from the basket
and, having washed it carefully, went to the
door.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Natty! Ah say, Mis’ Natty! Come
right heah, Honey.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie turned and smilingly nodded at
Rachel; then excused herself to Mr. Ames and
ran up the steps of the kitchen porch.
</p>
<p>
“See heah, Chile! Don’ you go an’ show your
ig’nance about farmin’ in front of dat country-man.
Now watch me, Honey, an’ den go back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
an’ play yoh knew it all dis time! Let Mis’r
Ames think yuh was funnin’ him.”
</p>
<p>
Rachel then took the large potato and showed
it to Natalie. “See dem leetle dimples in diffrunt
places on its skin? Well,—dem is called
‘eyes,’ and when a pertater gits ole, dem eyes
begins to sprout. Every sprout will make a pertater
vine, so farmers call dem eyes ‘pertater
seeds’—see?”
</p>
<p>
“Really! Why, Rachel, how interesting!”
cried Natalie, taking the potato and studying
the eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Yep! An’ what’s more, you’se kin cut a
pertater what has f’om two to six eyes a-growin’,
into pieces so one big pertater will plant as many
vines as pieces you cut outen him.”
</p>
<p>
“This potato has five big eyes, Rachel,” said
Natalie, counting carefully.
</p>
<p>
“An’ bein’ a great big pertater, I kin cut five
pieces—watch me.”
</p>
<p>
Rachel then deftly cut the five sections and
handed them to Natalie. “But it isn’t bestes to
cut so many slices, cuz the sap leaks out and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
loses a lot of de power to grow a sturdy plant,
Natty. When pertaters is plentiful, we gen’ally
cuts ’em in half—an’ the skin pertecks the sap
from runnin’ away. Ef we wants to use all dese
five pieces, we has to put ’em in the hot sunshine
fer an hour er two, to dry up de cut skin. Dat
keeps in de juice when de slice is in de ground.
And de juice is what feeds de sprout until it
grows above de ground.”
</p>
<p>
“Rachel, you are a brick! Now I can go back
to Mr. Ames and show off all I know!” laughed
Natalie joyously, as she ran from the kitchen and
joined Mrs. James and the farmer again.
</p>
<p>
But there was no opportunity for her to display
her knowledge, as Mrs. James had an invitation
ready for her. “Mr. Ames says he would
like to have us drive with him to his brother’s
farm and see a model little place. We can bring
back the potato seed and, at the same time, get
lots of good advice and ideas about running our
farm this summer.”
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes more the three were crowded
in upon the seat of the buckboard and Rachel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
stood in the kitchen doorway watching them
drive off. Their gay laughter echoed back to
her as she returned to the sink to finish the dishes,
and she smiled as she murmured to herself: “Ef
dis summer out on a farm don’ make dat chile
oveh inter a new bein’, den my name ain’t
‘Rachel!’”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—MISS MASON’S PATROL ARRIVES</h2>
<p>
The drive from Green Hill Farm to Mr.
Ames’s brother’s farm was enlivened for Mrs.
James and Natalie by the driver’s gossip about
the neighboring farmers whose places they
passed. One farmer made a speciality of raising
poultry, another tried to raise flowers, but his
greenhouses were not arranged well, and his
plants generally froze in cold weather. Still another
farmer planned to raise nothing but market-truck,
but he kept postponing the attempt
and thus never amounted to anything.
</p>
<p>
All these various plans gave Natalie food for
thought, and she had many schemes outlined in
her head by the time Mr. Ames drove in at his
brother’s farm-gate.
</p>
<p>
The house and front gardens were as neat as
wax, and one could see from the road that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
farm itself was well cared for. Mr. Ames spoke
the truth when he bragged of it as being a model
farm.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Ames came to the side door at the sound
of wheels crunching the gravel, and smiled a
welcome at her brother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
“I brung the leddies I tol’ you about,” explained
Mr. Ames, as he jumped out and turned
to help Mrs. James and Natalie.
</p>
<p>
After introductions were over, Mrs. Ames remarked:
“I’ll go call my husband. He’s at the
barns tryin’ to coax a few little pigs from the
mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! Are they tiny little pigs!” cried
Natalie excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,—not much bigger’n a kitten.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear! Can’t I see them?” asked she
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
Everyone laughed. “Of course you can,” returned
Mrs. Ames.
</p>
<p>
“We will all go and see them,” added
Mrs. James. “I like to see little creatures,
too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
So they all walked down the box-edged path-way
to the neat out-buildings where Mr. Ames
was struggling with two squirming little pink
pigs that were determined to run away.
</p>
<p>
Natalie stood and watched while the battle for
supremacy continued, and finally she offered to
help hold them. But this was not necessary, as
the farmer managed to get them in the pen
especially built for the larger pigs of the litter.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve got to be weaned and give the lean
ones a chance to grow better,” explained the
farmer, mopping his brow after the struggle had
ended.
</p>
<p>
Natalie was so interested in the barnyard cattle,
that the host escorted her about and showed
her many amusing and instructive things. Mrs.
James enjoyed this visit, also. The modern
chicken-houses and duck-yards were admired;
the pig-pens, with their clean runs and concrete
pools for the pigs to bathe in, were inspected by
an astonished Natalie who believed pigs to be
filthy animals; and all the other devices for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
cleanliness and comfort of the stock were commended;
and then they all went back to the
house.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Ames had hurriedly prepared refreshments,
although it was not more than ten o’clock.
Ice-cold butter-milk, home-made sponge cake,
and fruit, was a tempting sight. Natalie was
thirsty after the visit to the barns, and the cold
drink proved most refreshing.
</p>
<p>
While Mrs. Ames played hostess and showed
her visitors her flower gardens, the two farmers
went to the seed-house and sorted the potato seed
Natalie wanted for her own garden. Then several
tiny plants were added to this bag,—slips
that had been weeded out that morning, and
thrown out as superfluous in the Ames’s gardens.
These could be transplanted at once by Natalie,
and would go on growing, thus giving time for
the seeds to sprout.
</p>
<p>
Natalie enjoyed the flowers and the stock-yard,
but she was interested in vegetables, and
now she was anxious to get home and plant the
potato seed and other slips that had been donated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
Hence, the three visitors were soon on
their way back to Green Hill.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ames,” began Natalie, as they drove
away, “your brother said I could save time in
growing the corn if I would soak the kernels in
lukewarm water for several hours. He says the
soil is quite warm enough now for me to do this,
so the swollen corn will not get a chill when it
is dropped in the hill.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeh, I know that, too. I was goin’ to suggest
it,” returned Mr. Ames.
</p>
<p>
“He said the lukewarm water would start the
corn swelling better, and by the time Natalie
wanted to plant it the water would be cold and
the kernel would be the same temperature. The
soil would be about the same heat, so we would
not be running any risk of failure in hastening
the seed,” added Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Yeh—ye kin do that,” agreed the farmer.
</p>
<p>
“Another thing your brother said—that I
thought good, is this: when we plant slips, such
as beets, cauliflower, and other vegetables in a
garden bed, to keep the seeds of such kinds apart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
from the plant beds; then when the seeds sprout
they won’t confuse us with the older plants,” said
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ames,” now said Mrs. James, “your
brother says he always plants his corn in a rich
sandy soil with a mixture of gravel in it, to act as
a drain. The more sunshine it gets, the sweeter
it tastes, he said.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames glanced at the speaker with a pitying
look. “Diden yuh know that afore he tole
you?” was all he said.
</p>
<p>
Natalie nudged Mrs. James and giggled. But
the lady was not silenced by the farmer’s remark.
She was enthusiastic about all she had learned
and had to debate it with someone.
</p>
<p>
“He said that he seldom used a compost made
of cow-manure, unless it was seasoned with other
lighter fertilizer, as it was so heavy it kept all air
from permeating to the roots. <em>But</em> he added
that it formed a splendid foundation for other
mixtures to be added to it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, diden I say that same thing to yuh?”
demanded Mr. Ames.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but it is more satisfactory to hear your
advice seconded. Now we <em>know</em> you were right
in your suggestions,” said Mrs. James guilelessly.
</p>
<p>
“Right here, I wanta tell yuh-all that I brung
my brother up in his farmin’ knowledge. And
what he knows he learned from me when I was
votin’ an’ he was onny in knickers!” was Farmer
Ames’s scornful reply.
</p>
<p>
The rest of that day was spent in planting
potato seed, Rachel helping, so that the cut sections
need not be dried out. At sundown Mr.
Ames went for his horse and buckboard, saying,
</p>
<p>
“Wall, to-morrer yuh won’t need me, Mis’
James. Everything is goin’ on as fine as kin be,
an’ you’se know all about th’ seeds.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear, Mr. Ames!” cried Natalie, in distress,
“we will feel as if we are at sea without a
rudder.”
</p>
<p>
The remark pleased the farmer, for he was
proud of his experience and loved to have others
admit it. So he said: “Well, ef I git time I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
might run in at noon when I drives to the store
fer mail and house-goods.”
</p>
<p>
“Please do! We will need you by that time,
I am sure,” replied Natalie.
</p>
<p>
But the seeds and corn and other vegetable
products were planted without further mistakes
or delay. Each day saw the work advance and
by the time the city school closed the garden was
well on its way to producing edibles for that
season.
</p>
<p>
The tiny lettuce slips that Mr. Ames’s brother
had given Natalie were growing up fresh and
green; the radishes showed three to four sturdy
little leaves, evidence that tiny red balls were
forming under the ground. The cabbages and
cauliflowers began to present funny little button-like
heads above the soil; and the seeds were
showing slender little spears of green where the
soft earth was cleft by their protruding points.
The tomato vines and other plants started from
slips that had been weeded out from the Ames’s
farms were doing well; so that Natalie felt a
righteous pride in her garden.

<p>
A letter from Miss Mason came the last Friday
of school:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
<span class='sc'>Dear Natalie:</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Almost before you will have time to digest
the contents of this letter we will have descended
upon Green Hill Farm. The Girl
Scouts in my Patrol packed and shipped the
tents and other camping outfit, by express, the
first of the week. I wrote the man at the Corner
Store to hold them until we called there for them.
If Mrs. James, and Rachel and you, have nothing
better to do on Sunday, we will be pleased
to have you come to our camp and dine with us.
We hope to have everything in order and be
ready for guests by Sunday noon, as we will arrive
at Greenville about noon on Saturday.
Until then, I will wish you all rest and peace, as
you will need to draw heavily upon the reserve
fund of it after we arrive. My Girl Scouts are
an active, energetic patrol, and few of them ever
stop to sit down or sleep while in camp.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>Lovingly your teacher,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'><span class='sc'>Anna Mason.</span></p>
<p>
“Jimmy, Miss Mason says her girls will
be here Saturday—that’s to-morrow. But I
haven’t heard a word from the other girls about
when they will arrive! If only they could come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
up and be with us all on Sunday. Don’t you
suppose we could telephone Janet and let her arrange
it?” asked Natalie anxiously, after reading
the letter from Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps the girls are planning to pack up
and get away from the city for all summer when
they do come here. In that case, I don’t see how
they could manage to get away on Saturday.
But we can telephone and find out,” returned
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
So Janet was called over the ’phone, and Natalie
heard to her great delight that Janet was
coming Saturday evening even though other
girls in the group would not leave the city until
the middle of the following week.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon at sundown Natalie inspected
her garden critically, trying to judge it from another’s
point of view. When she returned to the
house she sat down on the piazza beside Mrs.
James and sighed.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose everyone will laugh at my garden.
The seeds aren’t big yet,—only the lettuce and
other things that I transplanted from the Ames’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
farms. Do you think they really will grow up,
Jimmy?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course they will. Does the sun shine or
do we succeed in growing <em>anything</em> from the
ground?” laughed Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“But this is different. I am not an experienced
farmer and maybe the vegetables won’t
grow for me.”
</p>
<p>
“The poor little seeds never stop to wonder
whether you are a farmer or not. They have no
partiality. It is their business to grow and
bring forth results, so they get busy and attend
to their business the moment they are planted.
But all things take time to develop,—so with
seeds. They do not give you a full-grown head
of lettuce or cauliflower in a night.”
</p>
<p>
This encouraged Natalie so much that she
went to sleep with the assurance that her garden
would thrive just as well as any farmer’s in the
county.
</p>
<p>
At noon on Saturday Natalie heard the laughter
and confused talking of many girls. She ran
to the side porch and saw Tompkins’ large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
spring-wagon approaching the house. Seated in
the back of the wagon was a bevy of happy girls,
and Miss Mason sat beside the driver.
</p>
<p>
“Here comes the Patrol, Jimmy!” shouted
Natalie, eagerly beckoning to Mrs. James, who
was in the living-room.
</p>
<p>
The wagon drove in the side gate and Si
Tompkins halted his horses while Miss Mason
called to Natalie:
</p>
<p>
“Want to jump in and go with us down to the
woodland?”
</p>
<p>
“Run along, Natalie, and I will come down
later,” said Mrs. James, smiling a welcome at the
merry party in the wagon.
</p>
<p>
In a few moments Natalie was up beside the
teacher, and the wagon moved on down the hill
to the river land.
</p>
<p>
Introductions were not given until the girls
had jumped out of the wagon and stood about
Miss Mason waiting for orders. Then Natalie
found the Girl Scout Patrol consisted
of nine happy, bright, intelligent girls, who
felt very grateful to her for the privilege
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
extended them to camp in her woodland that
summer.
</p>
<p>
The camping outfit had been packed in the
front end of the wagon, and when it was all removed,
the girls started immediately to pitch
their tents and do other necessary work for an
extended camping-time.
</p>
<p>
Natalie watched with interest and saw that
these girls knew exactly what to do. Miss Mason
selected a site where a cold water spring bubbled
up under a huge rock and formed a small
pool. The overflow ran down the woodland
bank into the stream. Quite close to this spring
the Patrol would camp, using the water for all
needs, and being far enough away from it to
keep camp débris from being blown, or thrown,
into the pool.
</p>
<p>
“Girls,” called Miss Mason to her Scouts,
“we will use this nice level spot up on the slight
elevation for the tents. Here we have natural
drainage away from our spring, and there is no
possibility of the river seeping up into the
ground under the tents. Even the hill back of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
us will not drain down upon our site, as there is
that shallow valley between our knoll and the
further hill.”
</p>
<p>
So the tents were raised where the Patrol
Leader designated, and here they found all the
advantages so desired by a group of campers:
plenty of sunshine part of the day, breezes whenever
the wind blew across the hills, privacy because
of the surrounding woods, plenty of dry
wood for camp-fires, water from the spring, and
the stream farther down to bathe and swim in.
</p>
<p>
Natalie watched the girls trench about each
tent, and she also saw that each tent was placed
about twenty-five feet from the next one. There
were four tents in all,—two large ones for the
girls and a smaller one for Miss Mason, while
a tiny one was for a pantry.
</p>
<p>
While five girls were engaged in completing
the tent arrangements, Miss Mason and the
other girls in the Patrol sought a suitable spot
for the latrine. Here they began to dig a trench
and build a shelter. Natalie went with them
and learned that a latrine must be away from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
water-supply and in the opposite direction from
which the prevailing winds blew toward camp.
Miss Mason was most particular about this work.
</p>
<p>
“That trench is not deep enough, Amy,” said
she to one Scout who was leaving the work.
“Every trench must be at least two feet deep,
one wide, and four feet long. Your pit is only
a foot deep, and you have not excavated the
dirt from either end. Dig it out clean and pile
it alongside so it can be thrown in again to cover
over any waste. This latrine is for summer use—not
for a week-end camp, you know.”
</p>
<p>
When the tents were up and ready for use,
Miss Mason called the Girl Scouts together.
</p>
<p>
“Now, girls, let us decide at once what shall
be the tasks assigned to each Scout for the coming
week. We will have a similar gathering
every Saturday afternoon while at camp, and exchange
duties so that every Scout in turn will
have the pleasure of doing certain duties for a
week all summer through.
</p>
<p>
“First, we will choose a Corporal to assist me
for the summer. We may vote for a new Corporal, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
allow Helen Marshall to hold her post.
Here are nine slips of paper to vote upon. Each
girl can cast a vote for Helen, or for another girl
in the Patrol, and no one shall know who writes
the vote. Sign no name to the paper, but we
will soon know what the general wish of the
group is.”
</p>
<p>
Eight girls voted for Helen to continue in the
Patrol as Corporal, and it turned out that Helen
herself voted for Mary Howe as Corporal.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Helen is our Corporal still. Now,
girls, form ranks so we can designate to each one
the duties of the week.”
</p>
<p>
The eight girls formed in two rows, four in
each row, with Helen at the front with the
Leader. Then Miss Mason began: “Mary, you
shall be camp cook for the first week. Amy is
water-scout. Mildred, you are camp-cleaner,—you
have all the baggage and tents to look after.
Lillian will look after the pantry and dishwashing.
Peggy must take full charge of the wood
and fire. Elizabeth will be the baker for this
week; Alice will see that the camp-grounds and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
latrine are kept clean and in order; and Dorothy
will have to be shopper and table-worker.
Helen, of course, is responsible for all work being
done properly, and I must supervise the Patrol
and advise each one on any problem. Now,
are there any questions to ask about the duties
assigned?”
</p>
<p>
Each Scout knew what was expected of her, so
there were no remarks at the time. Miss Mason
resumed her talk, to Natalie’s great delight.
</p>
<p>
“The fire-maker will immediately build a
luncheon fire, and the cook will begin preparations
for the midday meal, as we are hungry and
will lunch before planning further tasks.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Mason, where shall I find any food for
luncheon?” now asked the camp cook of the
Leader.
</p>
<p>
“In the soap box that the storekeeper placed
with the luggage. We have everything there
necessary to keep us in food over Sunday. The
edibles must be kept under shelter, girls, so reserve
the small tent for our pantry for a few
days.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
The wood-gatherer ran away to collect such
fire-wood as was needed for a slight fire to cook
luncheon, the table-scout selected a flat place to
spread out the table-cloth, and soon everyone in
the Patrol was working industriously. Natalie
had nothing to do, and Miss Mason came over to
her and entertained.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Natalie, in the life you’ve led since
you left New York, have you any reason to regret
coming to Green Hill Farm?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say not! Why, Miss Mason, these
two weeks have simply flown by,—I have had so
much to do, and have had so much fun doing it,”
exclaimed Natalie enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason smiled. “If you continue improving
in looks and health as you have in two
weeks, Natalie, no one will ever accuse you of
being delicate, or pessimistic. I should say you
can compete with Janet for health and vivacity
now.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you know Janet is coming this afternoon?”
asked Natalie eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, she told me the other day that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
ready to run away from the city the moment
school closed. She would have started from
home last night, but the expressman had not
called for her trunk and she had not left out anything
to use in case the trunk did not arrive here
on time. So they are checking it on her ticket to
insure its arrival to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be so glad to see Janet,—she always
inspires me with a desire to do more than I
want to when I am left to myself,” remarked
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“That is the effect of her natural energy and
activity,” added Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking, as I watched you call a meeting
of the Scouts, what a corking assistant Janet
would make in a Scout Troop. I don’t know
what name you give her in a Troop, but in
this Patrol you called her a Corporal,” said
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“In a Troop she would be called a Lieutenant,
but she would have to be eighteen years of
age, or over, and Janet is not that. So she
would have to be a Corporal for a time.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“Miss Mason, if we five girls want to form a
Patrol, can we do so and choose Janet for our
Corporal?” asked Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“If you had eight girls to form a Patrol you
could do so, but until you had that number you
would have to enlist with an already-formed Patrol.
You five girls might join us for a time
and, perhaps, secure enough girls living at
Greenville to complete the necessary number to
start a second Patrol. We have not applied at
Headquarters yet for a Charter to form a Troop,
but we hope to do so this year, if you girls can
found another Patrol and make our membership
claim two individual Patrols. I saw a number
of girls of your age on our way from the station
to Green Hill. I am sure those girls would hail
an invitation to join a Scout Patrol.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe they would, but I never thought of
any girls in Greenville, Miss Mason. I rather
thought they would be too busy with home
work, or their own pleasures, to bother about
Scouts.”
</p>
<p>
“There is where you wrong them. Not a girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
in the country but would love to join such an organization.
They can always find enough time
to do the necessary requirements of a good Scout,
and the pleasure and benefit they get out of a
Troop more than repays them for the time used.
I expect to interest all the girls of a membership
age around Greenville before we return to the
city this fall.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll talk it over with Jimmy, Miss Mason,
and see what she thinks of this idea. I believe
the Ames girl would join us, if we told her
about the plan,” said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“And once the Ames girl was a Scout, she
would tell her friends and they all would want to
join us,—see?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, if they thought it was going to be any
fun.”
</p>
<p>
At this point in the discussion the cook came
up and asked Miss Mason to show her certain
matters in connection with the soup-kettle. Natalie
laughed at the girl’s anxious expression.
But when Miss Mason invited her to come, too,
and tell them what was wrong with the pot, Natalie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
hastened to say she would have to go back
to the house and get ready to go to the station
for Janet!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—JANET FORMS A SECOND PATROL</h2>
<p>
Mrs. James and Natalie had engaged Amity
to call for them and drive them to the station to
meet Janet, and when the expected visitor arrived
there was a great display of delight on
Natalie’s part. All the way from the train to
the farm the two girls were eagerly exchanging
personal experiences since they had parted in the
city.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Nat,” began Janet, when a lull in confidences
gave her time to remember other things,
“Mr. Marvin told Dad that you had started a
vegetable garden all by yourself! Is that so?”
</p>
<p>
Natalie smiled joyously. “Yes, and this
morning I found my first tiny green spears
above ground, Janet! It is lettuce!”
</p>
<p>
Janet laughed. “You are the last one on
earth that I expected to take to truck-farming.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“But it is the most fun, Janet! I wouldn’t
get half as much entertainment out of travelling
or motoring as I am having from my garden.”
</p>
<p>
The moment the girls arrived at the house,
therefore, Natalie insisted upon Janet’s going to
her garden to see the tiny greens that were the
result of the seed-planting.
</p>
<p>
“Why, look at the fine things growing in those
other beds!” exclaimed Janet, allowing her gaze
to wander from the place where the almost imperceptible
green was showing above the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes,—those are tomatoes, potatoes, radishes,
cabbages, and other things. But these
particular beds are my very own work, so I feel
a great joy in them.”
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t the others yours, too?” asked Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but the plants were given me by Farmer
Ames. He threw some out of his own gardens
because they were too crowded for the best results.
I planted them, but I did not <em>raise</em> them
from seeds. My baby plants here are all my
very own!”
</p>
<p>
Janet laughed. She understood just how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
Natalie felt. It was the result of all her own
endeavor—these tiny seedlings.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said she, after admiring the garden
beds to Natalie’s utmost expectations, “I can’t
see what there is left for me to do, if you have
succeeded in your farming so soon.”
</p>
<p>
“I have been thinking of something for you to
do, Janet. We’ve got all those barn buildings,
but they are empty. If only you could keep
chickens and a pig,—wouldn’t that be great?”
said Natalie eagerly.
</p>
<p>
Janet laughed aloud. “Turn me into a stock
farmer? I never thought of it, but now that you
present the idea, it surely sounds fascinating.
Can’t you see me currying the horses, and milking
cows, or chasing a pig around the farm?”
</p>
<p>
“I am in earnest, Jan! You can easily keep
chickens and sell eggs. As for a pig—why, Mr.
Ames’s brother wants to sell a few of a litter he
has at his farm. They are the cutest little things
I ever saw. You’ll want to own one when you
see them.”
</p>
<p>
Janet laughed again, as Natalie’s suggestion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
was so foreign to anything she had thought of.
Not that it was unacceptable, however. The
more she thought of the plan, the more it appealed
to her as being worth while trying out.
</p>
<p>
That evening Mrs. James sat with the two
girls talking over the plan of keeping chickens
and other farmyard stock.
</p>
<p>
“I can manage the initial investment all right,
from my allowance that I have saved up, but how
do I know that the poor creatures will not die or
get sick under my management?” said Janet
laughingly.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got Mr. Ames near at hand, if a
chicken gets the pip,—that is what they get more
than anything else, I’ve learned,” said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Both her hearers laughed hilariously at her remark,
and Janet finally said: “Well, I just
think I’ll experiment for fun! Where can I buy
some chickens?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, any farmer will sell you a hen,” returned
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“But I want more than one hen,” said Janet.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to raise them yourself, just as I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
am raising vegetables from seeds. You get a
hen, put some eggs in a nest and make her sit
upon them. In three weeks you’ll have all the
young chicks you want to start with,” explained
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“It’s too bad to-morrow is Sunday, or I’d go
over to Farmer Ames in the morning and see
about hens and a pig,” said Janet regretfully.
</p>
<p>
“We’re all invited to go to the Scout camp to
spend the day to-morrow. But you and I will
start for Ames’s early Monday,” replied Natalie
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
So it was decided, after several hours’ serious
talk, that Janet should venture to raise chickens
and keep a pig.
</p>
<p>
The next day was very pleasant, and being
Sunday, Mrs. James permitted the two girls to
sleep an hour longer than was the daily custom.
When they were through with breakfast, and had
visited the gardens to see if any fresh spears
of green had made an appearance since the
previous evening, they all started for the Scout
camp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yoh-all go on ahead, an’ I’ll be along affer-while.
I’se goin’ to tote along a pan of hot biskits
fer the club,” said Rachel.
</p>
<p>
“All right, then we’ll warn the cook that she
need not worry about Scout bread for dinner,”
laughed Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
Janet was curious to visit the camp and see
what a lot of Girl Scouts did with themselves.
Natalie had told her about Miss Mason’s proposal
to interest some of the Greenville girls,
that, with the five who would live on the farm
that summer, they might organize a second Patrol,
and the two Patrols could then apply for a
Troop charter.
</p>
<p>
The Sunday visit proved to be very interesting
and satisfactory, for both girls saw how much the
Scouts could do that they had never dreamed of
before. The Sunday dinner that was prepared
and served by these girls was delicious, and
everything in camp was conducted according to
Scout rules. When Mrs. James and her two
charges were ready to start for the house, both
Natalie and Janet were enthused with the
ambition to launch a campaign for a second Patrol
without delay.

On the walk back home Natalie said: “We
ought to write the girls to get a Scout book for
themselves, and then come to Green Hill as soon
as possible. We need them to go around
and talk up the Scout idea with girls about
here.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish to goodness Helene was old enough to
be a Girl Scout. That would give us six girls,
instead of five,” said Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Helene can be a Scoutlet—because she is
under twelve—but I am not sure that that would
count in our Patrol,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
That night a letter was written to each of the
three girls remaining in New York, telling them
to go straightway to Headquarters and secure a
copy of “Scouting for Girls,” the handbook that
is necessary for a Scout to read and apply. Also
the three girls were urged to pack up and come
to the farm without losing any more valuable
time. But no mention was made of the reason
why this request was urged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
Natalie was up an hour before breakfast on
Monday and hurried to her garden to see what
had grown since the day before. To her great
surprise and joy, she found the corn had sprung
up an inch above ground since she had visited
her beloved gardens the day previous. So excited
was she that she raced back to the house,
shouting as soon as she came within call:
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy! Jimmy! My corn’s all up! Way
up, so’se you can see the blades!”
</p>
<p>
Rachel hurried out of the door to learn what
had happened, and when she heard the corn had
sprouted and caused all the commotion, she
laughed and shook her fat form in amusement.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James and Janet were most sympathetic,
and hurried with Natalie to the bed. Sure
enough! The green blades were bravely holding
up their pointed green heads as if to bless their
young planter.
</p>
<p>
“That’s because yesterday was such a hot day,
and the night was damp and dewy,” remarked
Mrs. James.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
By this time Natalie had gone to her other
vegetable beds, and now called out: “Oh, oh!
The beets and beans are up, too!”
</p>
<p>
To the great delight of the farmerette, it was
found that all the shoots had now broken through
the soil and tiny green heads were showing in
neat rows wherever Natalie had planted seeds.
This was very encouraging, and the three returned
to the house for breakfast in an exalted
frame of mind.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t s’pose there is anything more I can
do to-day to hurry them along, is there?” Natalie
wondered aloud, as they finished breakfast and
were discussing the wonders of a vegetable garden.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James laughed. “No, I should advise
you to start out as Janet and you planned, to interest
girls in a Scout Patrol to-day. By permitting
the vegetables to grow unwatched, they
will surprise you the more. Perhaps the corn
found courage to come out of the ground when it
heard you were not around to annoy it. Had we
been about the place yesterday, instead of at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
camp, the corn may never have dared come out
of hiding.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie glanced at the speaker to see if she
was in earnest, but Janet laughed merrily at the
words.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” ventured Natalie, “as we ought
really to find enough girls to fill our quota for a
Patrol, I think we will visit some of the families
to-day, and then attend to our farm work later.”
</p>
<p>
“How shall we manage to get around to the
different houses, Nat, if they are so far apart?”
asked Janet.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to sit on the steps and watch for
Mr. Ames to go by. When he comes in sight I
shall ask him to drive us to the Corners. He
will stop at Tompkins’ for an hour, most likely,
and by that time we can be ready to come back.
I want to call on Nancy Sherman and Hester
Tompkins. They are both about our age. On
our way back from the store, we will ask Mr.
Ames to tell us when he can drive us to his
brother’s farm to buy the pig. He may say we
can go this afternoon, and if he does, we’ll go!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll buy the pig, all right, but we’ll also get
the Ames girl to say whether she wants to be a
Girl Scout with us,” laughed Janet, admiring
Natalie’s clever plan.
</p>
<p>
“Janet,” remarked Mrs. James, “don’t you
see a great improvement in Natalie’s ambitions?
In the city she never gave a thought to planning
anything. Now she is all plans for the future.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I see Nat blossoming out into a regular
organizer,” laughed Janet. “If I don’t watch
out she will usurp my throne. I was always the
leader in the crowd of girls at school, but Nat is
fast getting ahead of me.”
</p>
<p>
The very idea of Natalie advancing ahead of
Janet made the girl laugh. But it pleased her,
too, to hear her friends praise her. She knew, as
well as anyone, that she was lazy and procrastinating
in the city. But now she was eager to do
things and to do them at once!
</p>
<p>
While she sat on the side piazza waiting for
Mr. Ames, she watched the robins alight on the
trees beyond the fence that divided the lawn from
the field. They called to others, and chirruped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
at a great rate, as they fluttered in and out
among the green branches.
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose makes them gather in
<em>those</em> trees? They have been there all day yesterday
and to-day. Can they be building community
nests?” wondered Natalie aloud to Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“I rather think they are after the cherries.
The fruit seems to have ripened quickly these
last two days, and robins are very fond of ripe
cherries.”
</p>
<p>
“Whose cherry trees are they, Jimmy?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, Natty, but the field is said to
belong to this farm, so I am going to ask Mr.
Ames if the cherries are on our property. You
see, they grow on the line with the fence, so I
cannot tell what the land-law says about them.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames was now seen driving leisurely
along the dusty road, and the three who were
awaiting him walked down to the gate and stood
under the great elm tree watching his approach.
</p>
<p>
“Good-mornin’,” called he, when within hearing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
“Good-morning,” chorused the waiting
group.
</p>
<p>
“I be’n thinkin’ sence yistiddy, when I druv
past them churry trees, there, that you’se oughter
pick ’em right off! Ef you don’t the durned
robins’ll spile all the fruit fer youh,” announced
the farmer, not waiting to draw up to the gate.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we wanted to ask you if the trees belonged
to us,” returned Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Why, sure! Who else kin claim ’em?”
said he.
</p>
<p>
“They stand on the fence-line, so we were not
sure,” explained Natalie, showing off her newly-acquired
land-learning.
</p>
<p>
“It ain’t that they’re standin’ on the survey line,
but that the last farmer here used them trees
fer fence-posts to nail the wire on. That saved
him three hull chestnut posts, see?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I see!” returned Mrs. James. “But
how far off the line is his fence? Are the trees
inside or outside the wire fence?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, as fur as I remember now, he ran the
fence about a foot this side the line-path. Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
proppity ackchully goes out a foot furder on the
road, but runnin’ the wire where he did, he managed
to get the use outen all them trees what
grow along the road. He saved ’most fifteen
dollars in posts by doin’ that.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James studied the situation for a few
moments and then said: “When was the wire
fence stretched on this line?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, lemme see!” and Farmer Ames
shoved his hat over one ear while he scratched his
head for the necessary intelligence to beam forth.
“That was the last year, before one, that he lived
here.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the fence has stood on that line about
three years?” persisted Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Yeh, about that.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, I’ll tell Mr. Marvin to order you
to change it. When you get time you can plan
to put up posts on the <em>right</em> property line and
remove the old wire fence.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie and Janet wondered why anyone
should bother over such a little matter, but Mr.
Ames understood, and smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“I reckon you knows somethin’ about proppity
law, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“I know this much—that if that fence is allowed
to stand without protest for a certain
time the land becomes public property, and Natalie
would have a lawsuit on her hands if she ever
sold it or wished to claim it again. The fence
should never have been placed back from the line,
even if it saved fifteen dollars. Those three
cherry trees are worth ten times that sum, and
once they become public property we can never
regain rights in them.”
</p>
<p>
Thus the two girls learned a bit of amazing
real estate law while they stood by the wagon.
When Mrs. James concluded, Natalie told Mr.
Ames they wished to go to the store, so he gladly
made room for them on the seat beside him.
</p>
<p>
Janet and Natalie had no difficulty in enlisting
Nancy Sherman and Hester Tompkins in a proposed
membership of the new Patrol, and these
two girls promised to interest Mabel Holmes and
Sue Harper. So there were already four girls,
each about fourteen years old.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure Dorothy Ames will join right off,
’cause she knows a girl at White Plains who is a
Scout, and Dot wanted to start something like it
here. But we didn’t know how to begin,” explained
Nancy Sherman.
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Ames was ready to drive home, his
two companions were ready also. Soon after
they had left the Corners Natalie spoke of their
desire to visit his brother’s to buy a pig.
</p>
<p>
Janet instantly added: “And I want some
chickens, too. Must I have a hen set on eggs to
raise them?”
</p>
<p>
“You kin do as you like about that! I kin
sell you’se some young chicks cheap, and you kin
raise ’em. Then you kin buy a settin’ hen and
raise a brood that way, too. An’ you’se kin keep
some old fowl fer layin’ aigs to use in the
cookin’.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, how much would all that cost me?”
worried Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Wall, the aigs fer settin’ ain’t more’n other
kinds. Th’ old hen’ll cost yuh about two dollars.
Layin’ hens cost about one-fifty each, an’ a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
rooster’ll cost near abouts two-fifty. The leetle
chicks won’t cost no more’n twenty-five cents
each.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that is fine! I can do that, all right!”
cried Janet delightedly.
</p>
<p>
“How much will the pig cost her?” asked
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Not much. When my brother has such a
big litter as this one is, I’ve known him to give
away a few of the little porkers before they cost
him anything fer feed.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie and Janet exchanged looks! Plainly
they said: “Oh, if only those pigs haven’t cost
him anything for feed!”
</p>
<p>
“How about keepin’ right on to my brother’s
farm, now?” asked Mr. Ames, as they drew near
the Green Hill house.
</p>
<p>
“That will be all right! We’ll just let Jimmy
know,” replied Natalie delightedly.
</p>
<p>
Farmer Ames was a kindly soul, but he had a
keen sense of business as well. When he heard
the two girls talk of buying a pig and chickens,
he wished to close the bargain without delay for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
his brother and himself. If they had time to
think it over, they might change their minds, and
he would lose a sale. So he proposed that they
go right on then and conclude the business.
</p>
<p>
“How about paying for them, now, Mr.
Ames?” asked Janet. “I have to write home
for my money, and that will take a few days.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t let that worry you any. Let my
brother do the worryin’ about his pay,” laughed
Mr. Ames jokingly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James consented to their going to the
stock-farm then and there, but reminded the girls
that the chicken-coops and pig-pens were not
ready to receive any living creatures yet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ll fix all that when we get back,”
called Janet as they drove away.
</p>
<p>
Janet found the stock-farm so interesting that
she almost forgot the real cause of their visit—the
enlisting of Dorothy in the new Patrol. The
little pink pigs were so alluring in their antics
that Janet decided to buy the three which had
been separated from the mother and had been
weaned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
The price asked seemed ridiculously cheap,
compared to what butchers in the city charged for
a pound of pork. So the three pigs were placed
in a small box and the top was slatted down to
keep the lively little things in bounds.
</p>
<p>
When this thrilling business matter had been
concluded, Natalie told Dorothy about the new
Patrol they wished to launch. They had no
trouble whatever in gaining Dorothy’s eager
consent to become a member, as she had long
wanted to be a Scout. So the two girls started
homeward about noontime, feeling that they had
accomplished a wonderful day’s business in many
ways.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll jest stop at my house to let you choose
some hens an’ chicks, an’ I’ll deliver ’em in the
mornin’, when I drive by.”
</p>
<p>
“Why can’t we take them along with us to-night?”
asked Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Cuz it is hard work to ketch hens in the daytime
whiles they are scratchin’ around. But onct
they go to roost at night, it is easy to get hold of
’em without excitin’ ’em too much.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
Natalie and Janet gazed at the various chickens
they found about the place, and Natalie whispered
to her companion when the farmer was not
near by:
</p>
<p>
“Janet, choose the biggest ones you see, because
Mr. Ames said they were all the same price.
Some of these are awfully small while some are
great heavy hens. You won’t be taking advantage
of him, you know, if he said we could take
any we liked.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so! I might take those big white
hens with the yellow legs,” replied Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, they’re nice-looking, too. Those dappled
ones are not a bit picturesque; nor are those
smaller hens with red-brown plumage. The
white ones will look so nice walking around our
lawn.”
</p>
<p>
So Janet selected six of the largest white hens
she could find in the entire flock of several hundred
chickens. Mr. Ames remonstrated in vain
that she had better take Rhode Island Reds, or
some of the guinea hens instead. She <em>wanted</em>
the big white ones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“And we’ll take that lovely rooster with the
wonderful tail,” added Janet, selecting one with
marvellous hues in his cock-plumes when the sun
changed its colors to variegated beauty.
</p>
<p>
“He ain’t no good fer a rooster, Miss,” said
Mr. Ames.
</p>
<p>
Natalie whispered advice again. “Janet, I
believe he wants to keep him for himself. Don’t
let him do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ames, I’ll take the one with those pretty
feathers, or I won’t buy any!” declared Janet
firmly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, all right, Miss. I don’t care what you
choose as long as you want them. But I’m tellin’
you-all, them hens is old and that rooster is
sickly,” explained Mr. Ames, in a tone that said
plainly: “I wash my hands of all your future
complaints.”
</p>
<p>
“Now how about the young chicks you told us
about? Can I buy some of them?” asked Janet,
when hens and rooster were noted on a paper.
</p>
<p>
“Yeh; come with me and I’ll show you the
kind you’d best get to start with. They’re about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
three to four weeks old and kin scratch fer themselves
and eat whatever they find. You kin let
them run wild, and they’ll get stronger that
way.”
</p>
<p>
Then the chicks were selected and Mr. Ames
found a hen that was wanting to set on a nest of
eggs. So he picked up the hen and put her in a
feed-bag. Both Natalie and Janet cried in fear
lest she smother before they reached home.
</p>
<p>
“Nah, she’s ust to such ways. I’ll set her
when we git over to Green Hill, and you gals kin
pick out the eggs and slip ’em under her to-night
when it is dark. Then she won’t bother
you.”
</p>
<p>
All this was very interesting to the two girls
who had never heard a word about raising chickens,
or setting hens, before. So Mr. Ames drove
them home in high spirits. The crate holding
the pigs was left by the kitchen steps, and the
hen placed in the coop on some china eggs, until
Janet could select other eggs.
</p>
<p>
On his way past the house again, Mr. Ames
called to Mrs. James: “Them churries oughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
be picked soon. Ef you want me and my man
to do it, we kin come this afternoon, likely.”
</p>
<p>
Rachel overheard and said: “Mis’ James,
pickin’ ox-hearts is fun fer gals. Dem trees is
jus’ bustin’ wid fruit a-waitin’ a lot of young
gals’ hands to pick ’em. Ef I wuz you, Honey,
I’d give Mr. Ames an answer in th’ mawnin’.
One night moh won’t hurt the fruit, nohow.”
</p>
<p>
The farmer sent an angry glance at Rachel,
but she met it with effrontery. When Mrs.
James said, “I think I will wait until to-morrow
before deciding,” Rachel grinned at the discomfited
man.
</p>
<p>
He drove away without loss of time, and
merely said: “I’ll bring them chickens over to-morrer.”
</p>
<p>
The moment he was out of hearing, Rachel
said eagerly: “Why, Mis’ James, them Girl
Scouts down at camp’ll give their haids to climb
them trees and pick cherries on shares fer you.
Charity begins to home, so let our gals get the
benefit, says I!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, Jimmy! Then Janet and I can help
them, too. It will be heaps of fun, I think. We
have a good ladder in the barn, and another
shorter one in the cellar, so some of us can pick
the outside boughs while the others climb up and
do the inside branches,” planned Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James studied the blue sky seriously.
Then said: “I suppose we ought to pick them
at once, then, while the weather is good. Once
a rain sets in, cherries will rot. The birds, too,
are ruining the ripe fruit with their pickings, so
we ought to begin work immediately after luncheon.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you, then!” exclaimed Natalie.
“While you and Rachel get the luncheon out,
Janet and I will hurry to camp and ask Miss
Mason if her girls want to do the work.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure they will be crazy to do it,” added
Janet.
</p>
<p>
So the two friends ran down to the woodland
camp where a bevy of merry Girl Scouts were
just finishing their dinner. Natalie told what
brought her there, and added: “We ought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
be able to pick all the cherries before sundown,
don’t you think so, Miss Mason?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, if so many of us work. But we
might break down the branches if we all climb
in the trees,” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Some of us will use ladders, and some climb
the trees. There are three, you know, so we can
plan to be on different boughs to pick,” explained
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
The Scouts donned their overalls which they
generally used in outdoor work about camp, and
started back with Natalie. At the house they
were told that the fruit was to be gathered on
shares, and each girl could sell her cherries to
Mrs. James, or keep them, as she chose. Then
the pickers were given baskets, or pails, and sent
to the trees, where Natalie and Janet joined them
after luncheon.
</p>
<p>
The step-ladder found in the attic was
brought down and placed under the tree with the
low boughs. One girl mounted this and began
to pick from its top step. The long ladder from
the barn was placed against another tree so that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
the topmost branches could be reached by careful
work, and a short ladder was put against the
lower boughs.
</p>
<p>
Natalie eagerly climbed up in the branches of
one of the trees and began to pick quickly. She
had a two-quart tin pail that was hung over a
short branch near her hands, and as she began
to pick the cherries, she sang or called to her
companions. Rachel smiled approvingly as she
heard her “Honey-Chile” so happy, then she
turned to go back to her kitchen and start a big
supper for so many Girl Scouts that night.
</p>
<p>
After a time, Janet called to Natalie: “Say,
aren’t a lot of the cherries bad from the pecking
the birds gave them?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and it’s a shame, too! I pick what
seems to be a luscious cherry, and when it is in
my hand, it turns out to have a great rotted spot
on the other side,” added one of the Scouts.
</p>
<p>
“If the birds would only keep at the same
cherry and finish it, instead of flying from one
to another and taking a nip out of each,” said
Natalie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see, they bite the ripe spot out of
the cherry, and then fly to another good ripe
mouthful. It is easier that way than trying to
turn their heads around the cherry to eat the
opposite side,” laughed Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Girls!” now shouted Natalie, making a
quick dash at something about her head. “Do
these horrid little yellow-jackets annoy you,
too?”
</p>
<p>
“They are after the decayed cherries,” called
a Scout.
</p>
<p>
“They are not yellow-jackets, are they? I
thought they were hornets,” said another Scout.
</p>
<p>
“They’re both—there is a hornet, now—buzzing
about my ear!” cried Janet.
</p>
<p>
At that very moment, a sharp scream from
Natalie caused every girl to turn her head and
see what had happened. In another moment a
crash of branches and a flash of a body falling
down through the leaves made several of the
Scouts cry out in fright.
</p>
<p>
Natalie had been picking the cherries from the
topmost branches, as she liked to sit up high and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
pelt the stones from the fruit she ate, down at
the girls’ heads, to tease them. The hornets had
a small nest in the top of the tree, but Natalie
was not aware of that. As she called and
laughed at her friends, the hornets began to grow
excited, and when they found the annoyance
failed to go away but came ever nearer their nest,
they buzzed about and threatened in angry
terms. Still Natalie paid no attention to what
they said to her. She thought they wanted to
feed on the rotten fruit, whereas they merely
wished her to go and leave them in peace.
</p>
<p>
At last the disturbance was too much for one
of the old hornets. He flew in circles about her
head and scolded until his exasperation took
form in the offensive. Natalie’s neck was a very
advantageous spot and she could not see him
when he lit on her collar and quickly crept up
to the soft smooth skin in the nape of the neck.
</p>
<p>
Without further warning he drove in his
dagger-point and Natalie screamed with pain.
Forgetting that she was up in a tree, and must
cling fast to the boughs, she suddenly put both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
hands to her neck. The natural result was, she
fell down so quickly that her friends could not
get to her assistance in time to do a thing.
</p>
<p>
Smaller twigs and branches had given way
with her weight and she would have fallen to the
ground, had not a friendly bough caught her
under the arms and suspended her momentarily.
Then the smaller bough that grew from the
friendly one snapped short off under the girl’s
weight, and the sharp up-thrusting section left
on the tree ran right through the suspender-straps
at the back of her overalls. There she
hung, like a toy doll on a Christmas Tree,—her
feet dangling and her head and hands helplessly
held out to be taken down by some kind friend.
</p>
<p>
The terrifying scream brought Rachel running
from the kitchen and Mrs. James up from
the cellar, where she had gone to hunt for more
containers for the cherries. When Rachel saw
what had happened she wrung her fat hands in
agony.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, m’ Honey! My li’l’ chile—hang on t’ dat
limb fer all you’se wuth!” yelled she. Then she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
rushed over the grass to the rescue,—but Natalie
dangled just out of reach above her head.
</p>
<p>
Janet slid down the rough trunk of the cherry-tree
the moment she heard her friend shriek.
Her thin stockings hung in strips when she
reached the ground, and her legs were skinned
from knees to ankles, but she felt no pain, as she
was so excited over the outcome of this accident.
</p>
<p>
“Quick! Someone get that step-ladder we
had here!” cried she, jumping up and down in
her fear that Natalie would let go and fall; yet
she was too excited to run for the ladder herself.
</p>
<p>
Rachel instantly comprehended and jumped
across the intervening space between the two
trees and caught a firm hold of the lower part
of the step-ladder. She never stopped to see if
anyone was on the top step. But one of the
Scouts had been standing on it with her form hidden
in the foliage of the tree. As Rachel whirled
the ladder out from under her, the Scout was left
in mid-air, instinctively clutching the branches to
save herself.
</p>
<p>
The other Scouts had descended the trees by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
this time, and some ran over to help save Natalie,
while others stopped under the tree where the
new accident threatened to take place.
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help!” yelled the girl who was dangling
from a bough.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason had been measuring the cherries
impartially, half for the individual pickers and
half for Mrs. James, when the first accident happened.
She was out of the house and crossing
the grass when the second scream reached her
ears. She saw an old hemp hammock hanging
from a clothes pole on the drying-place, and had
a sudden idea.
</p>
<p>
The hammock was snatched and carried over
to the tree where the Scout hung. “Here, girls!
Spread it out quickly! We will have a life-saving
net and win a reward for our presence of
mind!” ordered the teacher.
</p>
<p>
The Scouts instantly obeyed and the net was
spread even as May wailed: “I have to let go!
My hands won’t hold on longer!”
</p>
<p>
“All right! Drop!” commanded Miss Mason.
“We’ll save you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
May yelled and let go. She was caught in the
meshes of the old hammock, but the hemp was
so rotten that in another moment it separated
and let May down on the grass. However, it
had answered its purpose, for the time, and had
broken her fall.
</p>
<p>
While this “first-aid” was being given,
Rachel ran, in great excitement, back to assist
Natalie. She had hastily placed the extra-high
step-ladder under the tree and, without taking
time to see that the braces that hold back and
front sections firmly apart were <em>not</em> taut, she
began to mount the steps to reach her “Honey.”
</p>
<p>
Half-way up, the now overbalanced ladder
started to sway uncertainly, and Rachel gasped
as she wildly tried to clutch something to steady
herself. Natalie’s feet were the only available
things in sight.
</p>
<p>
“Ough! Mis’ James! Heigh, down dere—someone
grab hol’ on dis ladder!” shouted
Rachel, her eyes almost popping from her head.
</p>
<p>
“Wait! Hold on, Rachel!” called a chorus
of voices below.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
The ladder was still quaking uncertainly when
Rachel lost courage and began to descend precipitously,
without stopping to find a sure footing
on the steps. Consequently, she missed the
second step from the bottom and sat down unceremoniously
in a bushel of ripe ox-hearts.
</p>
<p>
“Umph!” was the grunt that was forced from
her lungs, but the Scouts all howled with dismay
when they saw the result to their patient cherry
picking.
</p>
<p>
Janet did not stop to see what was occurring
to Rachel. The moment she saw the mammy
come down, she ran up the steps and steadied
herself by holding to the bough from which Natalie
still swung. Miss Mason managed to hold
the bottom of the ladder until Janet had guided
her friend’s feet to the top step. Then the strain
on the suspenders was loosened and it was easy
to unbuckle the straps at the back of the overalls.
</p>
<p>
In a few more moments, Natalie was helped
down the ladder and once more stood on <em>terra
firma</em>. But such a funny sight was presented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
her when she breathed in safety once more, that
she momentarily forgot the hornet sting and
laughed wildly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James had called several of the Scouts to
help her in pulling Rachel up out of the bushel
basket upon her feet again. This muscular deed
was accomplished just as Natalie stepped down
on the ground. But Rachel’s percale bungalo-gown
was a sight!
</p>
<p>
The luscious ripe cherries were mashed all over
her skirt, and half of the fruit in the basket was
crushed as if done by a fruit-press. Rachel was
torn between two fires—that of humble apology
to the scout-pickers for spoiling their “fruits of
labor” and concern over Natalie who was holding
her hand over the back of her neck. Mother-instinct
that was so deeply rooted in Rachel, although
she had never had a child of her own, won
the day and she ran over to Natalie to ascertain
the extent of the troublesome sting.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mah pore Honey! Mah sweet li’l’ chile—did
dem nasty bees sting yoh?” Rachel cried,
enfolding Natalie in her capacious embrace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
Then she added, “Now jus’ you-all wait a minit,
chillun, an’ I’ll soon git dat stinger out.”
</p>
<p>
Consequently she made a soft paste of mud
and water, and slapped a handful of it on Natalie’s
neck. Then she tied a towel over it to keep
it in place.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Honey, yoh jus’ sit heah wid yoh haid
down in front, so’s dat mud won’t run down yoh
back,” advised she.
</p>
<p>
Natalie obeyed, albeit the mud did ooze in
trickles down her back and fill up at her belt in a
dried lump.
</p>
<p>
The pain of the sting was soon over, and Natalie
tried to gather some more cherries, but she
kept away from the top of the tree where the
hornets still buzzed angrily about. The other
Scouts also kept a safe distance from that
nest.
</p>
<p>
By sundown all the cherries were picked, and
the quantity evenly divided into shares. Each
girl had made a pile of the fruit she gathered,
and so no Scout felt that another was benefiting
by her work. But when all was measured out, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
was found that the girls had picked about the
same quantities, with but little variation.
</p>
<p>
That evening while enjoying Rachel’s bountiful
supper, the Scout girls were told about the
new Patrol that Janet and Natalie were hoping
to start. That was a very engrossing subject
and no one gave a thought to things outside, until
it was time for the Scouts to return to camp.
Then a plaintive squealing came from a crate
placed on the piazza, and Janet suddenly remembered
the pigs.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, horrors! Will little pigs die if they have
been left without a thing to eat for a day?”
wailed she, as she clasped her hands in shocked
concern.
</p>
<p>
Everyone laughed at her, and Mrs. James
said: “Not if you attend to them at once. But
they will have to live in the crate overnight, as
nothing can be done about housing them
now.”
</p>
<p>
So Rachel mixed a dish of warm milk and corn
meal for the wailing squealers, and soon hushed
their clamorings. Janet felt guilty of gross neglect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
on the first night of her business investment,
but Natalie tried to condole with her by saying:
</p>
<p>
“Well, cherries, and pigs, and new Scouts
can’t all be gathered in one day, you know.”
</p>
<p>
This created such a laugh at the quaint combination
of the triple interests, that Janet felt
relieved in mind. After the Scouts had gone
back to camp, Natalie reminded Janet of the
eggs they were to give the hen for setting.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll do that now,” said Janet anxiously.
</p>
<p>
So the two girls went to the pantry without
asking advice of Rachel or Mrs. James, and
counted out twelve eggs. These were carefully
carried to the hen-coop and after many wild
squawkings from the hen, and concerned action
by the two farmerettes, seven of the twelve eggs
remained unbroken and were placed under the
future mother of a family.
</p>
<p>
“My! I wouldn’t want to experience a skirmish
with a hen very often,” said Janet, counting
the scratches on her hands and arms after they
reëntered the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“Neither would I,” agreed Natalie, holding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
her hands and wrists under the cold water faucet
to let the cooling flood wash away the signs of
battle with the hen’s sharp bill.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she’s got seven sound eggs to hatch,
anyway. When we get time to spare, we will
put a few other eggs under her, so we can have
the full dozen chicks as Mr. Ames advised.”
</p>
<p>
“I never knew it was such a simple matter to
raise chicks, did you?” remarked Natalie, as she
wiped her hands on the kitchen towel.
</p>
<p>
“No, and when you think of all the money we
pay for roast chicken in New York, it makes you
want to live always on a farm, doesn’t it?” added
Janet.
</p>
<p>
But neither girl knew that many store eggs
were not suitable for hatching chicks. They had
not examined the yolks as chicken farmers do,
to see if the egg was fertilized. So they had
placed two suitable eggs, and five unfertilized
eggs, under the hen. When but two chicks
would result from that experiment, what a disappointment
there would be. Janet would be
sure to declare that stock-raising wasn’t such an
easy business, after all!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—TRIALS OF A FARMER’S LIFE</h2>
<p>
Mr. Ames brought the chickens and hens early
in the morning, and so interested was Natalie in
Janet’s stock-investment that the vegetable gardens
were quite forgotten for a few days. Sunday
she had spent at camp with the Girl Scouts;
Monday she and Janet had gone to the Corners
and enlisted girls to join them in a new Patrol,
and in the afternoon they had picked cherries;
then on Tuesday the chickens came, and some
sort of a house had to be built for the pigs, as
well as for the hens. So three days had passed
by and she had not had time to inspect her gardens.
</p>
<p>
Farmer Ames acted huffy because the cherries
had all been gathered when he drove up to the
kitchen door in the morning. So he merely delivered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
the crate containing the hens and young
chicks, and having handed Rachel the basket of
eggs for the setting hen, drove away again.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me! I wanted to ask him how big a
pen to build for three pigs!” sighed Janet, when
she heard he had gone.
</p>
<p>
“No ’count why he hes to tell yuh that! I
rickon anyone like me, what’s borned and
brought up on a farm in Norf Car’liny, kin help
dat way, better’n an ole grumpy farmer in Noo
York state,” announced Rachel.
</p>
<p>
“All right, Rach, I’ll be thankful of your advice,”
replied Janet, gazing down at the squirming
pigs.
</p>
<p>
So Natalie and Janet occupied themselves
most industriously in the building of a pig-pen
for the little porkers, and in mending the old hen-house
and chicken run. A separate coop was
found where the setting hen might brood quietly
on the eggs, and the young chicks were given
their freedom of the place, because Rachel said
they would grow much faster if they could run
about and scratch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
But this advice had dire results, as Natalie
learned, too late.
</p>
<p>
By sundown the pigs were nicely housed, and
the old hens and rooster found comfortable roosts
in a remodelled hen-house. The young chicks
clustered together in the chicken yard and were
driven inside the house by the persuasive
“s-sh’s” and waving hands of the concerned
farmerettes.
</p>
<p>
These important matters disposed of for the
day and Rachel not having announced supper,
Natalie said: “Come with me to see my garden.
I haven’t had a moment’s time to visit it
lately.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose the lettuce is large enough to pull,
now,” laughed Janet teasingly.
</p>
<p>
“No, but I shouldn’t be surprised if the radishes
that were transplanted from Ames’s garden
were big enough to use.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls went arm-in-arm down the pathway
and when they reached the old box hedge
that divided the vegetable beds from the back
lawns, they stood for a moment listening to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
echo of merry laughter coming from the woodland
down by the river.
</p>
<p>
Then Natalie came to the first garden
bed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! Look,—Janet! What has happened
to my beans?” cried she shrilly, as she
stood gazing in horror at what she saw.
</p>
<p>
Janet gazed, too. The tiny green things that
had looked so fresh and pert a few days before
were out of the ground in many places, and the
soil was unevenly scattered in small heaps.
From this havoc, Natalie quickly looked over at
the lettuce bed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! How dreadful! Look at that garden
bed! Why, all the lettuce is cropped off close
to the ground. <em>What</em> could have done it,
Janet?” her eyes filled with tears and her voice
threatened an imminent howl.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me, Nat! I don’t know what has
happened!” said Janet, deeply concerned for
her friend.
</p>
<p>
The two then hastily visited the other beds,
and found the radishes and potato plants undisturbed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
but the corn was dug up in spots and the
remaining blades half-eaten.
</p>
<p>
Without a thought for the tender green still
remaining, Natalie suddenly collapsed upon the
corn hills and gave vent to a heart-breaking cry.
Once the flood-gates were down, she wept and
wailed and would not be comforted. Finally
Janet ran to the house and summoned relief.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James and Rachel hurried after her to
soothe the crying damsel in the corn field; but
Rachel understood what had taken place in that
garden, even as she raced past the half-destroyed
vegetable beds.
</p>
<p>
She knelt down beside Natalie and tried to
pacify her by endearing terms, but the amateur
farmer was too sorry for herself to pay any attention
to Rachel. All she could gasp forth was:
“If I ever find out who did this, I’ll kill them!”
</p>
<p>
Rachel sent Mrs. James a knowing look, and
nodded toward the barnyard. Thus the lady
gathered that the hens and chicks had feasted on
the tender greens and had dug up the soft rich
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
soil in seeking for earthworms when they had
been turned loose that day.
</p>
<p>
Darkness slowly crept up from the river banks
and the four finally turned to go in to supper.
As they reached the box hedge, Rachel remembered
the boiling potatoes that were almost
cooked when she was summoned hastily by Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, laws! I betcher they am all black as
cinders by this time!” cried she, making a leap
to escape over the hedge and reach the kitchen in
a hurry.
</p>
<p>
A dense smoke was seen issuing from the open
door of the kitchen, and Rachel’s three followers
forgot their recent troubles in this new disaster.
</p>
<p>
Just as they reached the steps of the back
porch, Rachel rushed the smoking pot out of the
door and ran with it to the grass beside the board-walk.
</p>
<p>
“Dere ain’t no smell on eart’ ner unner de
eart’ to beat dis smell o’ burnin’ pertaters!”
growled Rachel angrily, as she planked the
blackened cooking pot down upon the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Oh my! The kitchen is full of smoke!” exclaimed Janet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
who had poked her head in at the
open door.
</p>
<p>
“Did you’se ’speck it to be sweet an’ free as
hebben?” snapped Rachel scornfully.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James said nothing but quickly drew the
two girls aside to the other door to permit Rachel
to calm her perturbed nerves. Then Natalie remembered
her beloved garden.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy, who could have been so mean as to
do that?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, I wasn’t present, Natalie, dear.
But I have heard that crows love to dig up corn
kernels in a newly-planted field, so that farmers
have to use scarecrows to keep them off. Maybe
some sort of a bird found the toothsome greens
and called to all the family to hurry and feast
while there was time.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie pondered this idea for a time, but it
never occurred to her to lay the trouble at the
heels of the chickens. But she determined to lose
no time in dressing up the most frightful scarecrow
that was conceivable.
</p>
<p>
After the unscorched remainder of the supper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
was served, Rachel came to the dining-room to
make a suggestion.
</p>
<p>
“Ef we-all git up earlier than us’al to-morrer
mornin’ we kin git all dem rooted-up plants back
in the groun’ afore sun-up. Mebbe it will rain
to-morrer, then no harm’ll come of diggin’ up all
dem roots.”
</p>
<p>
The mere possibility of rain made Natalie
jump up from the table and, quickly excusing
herself, run out on the porch to study the
heavens.
</p>
<p>
“Not a star out, and the sky looks awfully
cloudy,” cried she hopefully, as she returned.
</p>
<p>
“Then we’ll all get up at dawn and begin
work in making amends in the garden,” said
Mrs. James consolingly.
</p>
<p>
The little plants were replanted early in the
morning and certain spots where the soil had
been scratched away were smoothed out again, so
that only a close observer would have seen that
there were places here and there where no vegetables
grew.
</p>
<p>
About seven o’clock a fine drizzle began, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
Natalie welcomed it with sparkling eyes. “<em>Now</em>
the roots can have time to get freshened again
before a hot sun comes to dry things up.”
</p>
<p>
A letter came that morning telling Natalie
that Norma, Frances, and Belle would soon be
ready to leave the city. By counting from the
date of the letter, it was found that they would
be at Greenville that very day on the noon train.
Probably the letter had been delayed in coming,
or had been overlooked in some way.
</p>
<p>
“We had better send word to Amity, by Mr.
Ames, that he is to meet the train they come on,”
suggested Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
But the girls watched for Mr. Ames in vain
that morning, and noon hour came and still no
word had been sent to Amity. Janet was out
feeding the pigs when she heard a shout from
the road. She looked up wonderingly and saw
the three girls tramping along in the rain and
mud, trying to manage suit-cases and umbrellas
at the same time, as they jumped puddles or
avoided a stretch of mud.
</p>
<p>
She ran to the house and called Natalie. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
another moment, both girls were out on the side-piazza
waiting to take the luggage from the bespattered
girls.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! Why don’t you move
nearer the railroad station, Nat?” complained
Norma.
</p>
<p>
“That horrid hackman wouldn’t give us a lift,
although he was sitting at Tompkins’ store toasting
his feet at a stove,” added Belle, angrily.
</p>
<p>
“At a stove! In summer?” cried Natalie,
wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but there was no fire in the thing. He
was tilted back in a wooden chair telling stories
to some farmers, and his old horse was standing
out in the rain, patiently waiting for a bag of
oats,” said Frances.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James joined the group now, and overheard
the last words of complaint. “I don’t see
why he could not drive you here, as long as he
was not engaged.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s exactly what Belle asked him, but he
said: ‘Can’t you see I <em>am</em> engaged? I must not
interrupt this talk on polerticks. It’s mos’ votin’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
time and we-all has to get facks afore we cast a
ballot,’” laughed Norma imitating Amity.
</p>
<p>
“Did you entice him with extra pay?” asked
Janet laughingly.
</p>
<p>
“What was the good? He just ignored us, so
we had to walk the rest of the way here,” Frances
said. “But I made up my mind to one thing:
If that is the way the only cab-man of Greenville
treats his trade, I’ll cut him out of it all, if I can
manage to have <em>my</em> way.”
</p>
<p>
They were all in the living-room now, and had
removed muddy overshoes and wet coats and
hats. Rachel was hastily brewing some hot tea
to make everyone feel more cheerful, so the girls
sat and talked.
</p>
<p>
Natalie instantly asked Frances what she
meant.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Daddy and mother are going out to
Colorado for the summer, and the machine will
be put up in a garage, or I will have it out here
to use. Now I’ve been thinking over all Nat
said about each one of us earning some money
this summer, and I couldn’t think of a single
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
thing I could do. But that cranky old hackman
gave me a cue: I’ll use the car out here for the
people who wish to travel back and forth, or take
a drive to certain places. I ought to be able to
save quite a sum before fall,” explained Frances
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Frans, that will be fine! We will be your
best customers,” laughed Janet, while the other
girls all approved the plan.
</p>
<p>
“That seems like Frances’ golden opportunity,
but Norma and I haven’t found a thing to
do, yet,” added Belle.
</p>
<p>
“You will, never fear. Janet found her vocation
the first day she was here,” laughed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Then Janet had to tell about her stock-raising,
and her friends laughed heartily when they
heard about the first night the piggies arrived at
their new home.
</p>
<p>
“The chickens are doing fine! I had to keep
them shut up in the yard to-day to get them
thoroughly acquainted with their surroundings,
so they won’t run away,” said Janet, but she did
not say that they were kept locked up for fear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
they might wander over to the garden again and
create more trouble.
</p>
<p>
“I should think you would have a cow and sell
milk,” suggested Belle laughingly.
</p>
<p>
“Cows cost a lot of money. I priced one of
Ames’s and when I heard the sum, I lost interest
in milk,” replied Janet, causing the girls to
laugh at her explanation.
</p>
<p>
“But I am going to buy some ducks as soon
as my new allowance is due. There is plenty of
water for them to swim in and ducks look so
rural, don’t you know,” added she.
</p>
<p>
“But they are difficult to raise, Janet,” said
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Why? If you let them swim about and give
them enough feed, what more can they want?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, but they take certain spells of
sickness quicker than any other fowl and, in a
day or two, the whole flock droops and dies off.
Geese are much easier to rear and bring better
prices in the market, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, then I’ll have geese. But I’ve heard
they chase one, if they don’t like you,” said Janet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
“They wouldn’t chase you if you fed them;
and should they take it into their geese-heads to
run anyone else out of the yard, it will be a warning
for others to keep away.”
</p>
<p>
The drizzle stopped after luncheon, so that the
girls put on raincoats and oil-skin caps and
started to visit the Scout camp. On the way,
they visited Natalie’s garden and extolled her
work and patience that had brought forth such
results.
</p>
<p>
Natalie beamed like a full moon at the deserved
praise and explained how wonderful the
vegetables were before the dastardly birds dug
everything up.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Nat, I know,” remarked Belle. “It’s
almost like the wonderful fish one just missed
catching, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
Everyone laughed at this, even Natalie joining
in at her own expense. “Well, I don’t care!
They <em>would</em> have been much better if they had
not been interfered with,” said she.
</p>
<p>
After leaving the garden, Natalie opened the
subject of the Scout Patrol that would be an offshoot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
of Miss Mason’s first Patrol. This would
give both Patrols the opportunity to launch the
Troop.
</p>
<p>
“Fine! How soon can we begin?” said
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Well talk it over with Miss Mason this
afternoon. I haven’t had time, yet, to tell her
about the Greenville girls who agreed to join us,
as Janet and I have had <em>so</em> much to do since
then,” explained Natalie.
</p>
<p>
The girls were now near enough to the woodland
to hear the sound of singing. Mrs. James
held up a hand for silence and they stood and
listened. It sounded very wonderful from the
hillside where they were to hear the blending of
soprano and alto voices in the national anthem
“Our America.” There was a martial impetus
in the singing that spoke well for the patriotism
of the Girl Scouts.
</p>
<p>
“What does Miss Mason call her Patrol,
Nat?” asked Norma, as they resumed their way
to the river.
</p>
<p>
“Now that you speak of it, Norma, I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
confess that I never asked. Isn’t it funny that I
never thought of it?” said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“But we will ask now, and find out. Of
course we will have to use the same name if Miss
Mason has already chosen one for a Troop,” said
Janet.
</p>
<p>
The visitors reached the camp site and found
the Scouts holding a council meeting. They had
just finished the patriotic song and Miss Mason
was opening the meeting by an address. The
unexpected guests were invited to sit down on a
huge log and hear the Leader’s speech.
</p>
<p>
“The members of this Patrol know the reason
for this council, but I will explain to the newcomers,
too,” said Miss Mason, turning to Mrs.
James and the girls.
</p>
<p>
“We have decided to send to Headquarters
in New York to ask to be enrolled as a Troop,
now that we have had more than a year’s experience
with the organization. Because you girls
wish to start another Patrol and unite with our
Troop, we think it urgent to be registered and
chartered by the National Headquarters, and be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
able to own a flag and choose a title and crest
for our use.”
</p>
<p>
The visiting girls exchanged glances with each
other, as the question just asked Natalie was
about to be answered now. Miss Mason did not
see their looks and proceeded with her explanation.
</p>
<p>
“We chose a name when first we started our
Patrol but we have never registered it, and there
was a question whether we would care to change
it after a time. We called ourselves the ‘Solomon’s
Seal Patrol’ as having so much meaning
to the name. We think that the reflected glory
of Solomon’s wisdom is better than none. So
we have decided, now, to christen our Troop
by that name. We will vote on this later. At
present I wish to mention a few other points.
</p>
<p>
“I am now about to speak of a new Patrol, or
new members, so it is fortunate that our visitors
arrived in time to hear all I have to say.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose every girl present has a manual:
‘Scouting for Girls’?” Everyone nodded in
the affirmative, and Miss Mason continued:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then you will read on page 44, that every
girl who wishes to enroll as a Scout must be at
least ten years old and must have attended meetings
for a month, during which time she will have
passed her Tenderfoot Test. During the first
month she is known as a Candidate. When she
knows the meaning of the Promise and the Laws,
and is sure she understands the meaning of the
oath she is about to take, and comprehends the
meaning of ‘Honor,’ she is eligible to be a Tenderfoot.
</p>
<p>
“My Girl Scouts passed the Tenderfoot class
last year, and then took the Second Class Test,
which was also passed successfully by them. We
are all ready to pass the First Class Scout Test,
except that each girl must present a Tenderfoot
who has been trained by the candidate. This is
our opportunity, as you girls all wish to be
Scouts, and my girls can train you, thus giving
them the privilege of being First Class
Scouts.
</p>
<p>
“I was going to speak of other things, but
since our visitors’ arrival, I wish Mrs. James to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
tell us how many girls she knows on whom we
can count for the new Patrol.” Miss Mason
turned to Mrs. James and waited.
</p>
<p>
“Natalie knows more about the matter than I,
Miss Mason, as she and Janet went about the
Corners securing the candidates. Let her tell
us about it,” replied Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
Natalie was called upon to address the audience
and so she got up and spoke. “Janet and I
called on Nancy Sherman and Hester Tompkins
and secured their promise to join our Patrol as
soon as we were ready for them. Then we went
to Dorothy Ames’s house and got her interested.
With these girls”—Natalie waved her hand at
the four girls sitting on the log,—“we will have
eight applicants. Janet has a younger sister
Helene, who is not twelve yet, so we are not sure
whether we want her to belong to our Patrol.
All of us girls are over twelve and it is more fun
when girls are nearer an age. I’ve been thinking
that Helene might start a Brownie Troop, a
younger Patrol than ours. We might allow
them to join us, later on.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
As Natalie sat down, the girls of Solomon’s
Seal Patrol showed their delight at the progress
made in the enlisting, and Miss Mason commended
the two who had visited the girls of Four
Corners and had interested them in the proposed
plan.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. James, have you thought of a Leader
and Corporal for Natalie’s new Patrol?” asked
Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>
“I fear I am not well enough versed in scouting
to take such a responsibility upon myself.
I would prefer having you do it,” responded
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“I’d rather not be any officer, Miss Mason,”
exclaimed Natalie, “because they always have
to work while the others have a good time. I’ll
just be an every-day Scout.”
</p>
<p>
The girls laughed, as there was more reason
than rhyme in the statement. But Miss Mason
said: “There’s always one girl in a group who
has the knack of directing her companions. Such
a girl ought to be an officer.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, for goodness’ sake, choose Janet for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
our manager,” exclaimed Natalie. “She always
runs us and everything concerned with us.”
</p>
<p>
The Scouts laughed, and Miss Mason nodded
her head. “I always thought as much, but you
will confess, Natalie, that she makes a pretty
good general, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Janet blushed with pleasure at the teacher’s
praise, and Natalie smiled: “Oh, <em>pretty</em> good!”
Then she grinned at her friend.
</p>
<p>
“Janet, will you act as Patrol Leader for your
new Scouts?” asked Miss Mason, turning again
to Janet.
</p>
<p>
“I will, if Natalie will be my Corporal,” returned
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Seeing that there are only two members in
our Patrol as yet, I can’t see how I can get out
of being either one or the other,” laughed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but we will have more members shortly,
and this office of Corporal must be considered as
binding until a new election,” explained Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Well then, Jan, if you can bear up under
the arduous duties of a Patrol Leader, I reckon I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
can survive the work of acting as your Corporal,”
retorted Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“All right. Then we’ll enroll our Tenderfoot
Scouts in a Patrol before the next official
meeting here, and begin training them in the
path that they should follow,” agreed irrepressible
Janet.
</p>
<p>
After this, many subjects that interest Girl
Scouts were taken up and discussed, and the
girls from Green Hill Farmhouse were more
deeply impressed with the wonders of scouting
than they had dreamed possible. Each girl determined
to do everything possible to learn as
much that summer as those Girl Scouts of Solomon’s
Seal knew.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—NORMA AND FRANCES LAUNCH THEMSELVES</h2>
<p>
Frances lost no time in putting her idea for
business into operation, so she wrote her father
that night, asking him to let her have the automobile
at Green Hill Farm for the summer instead
of storing it with some big garage company.
She did not say that she wished to start a
service route to earn money, but she did say that
there was a fine barn on the farm where the car
could be kept, and it would give them all such
pleasure to be able to drive about the lovely
country in Westchester.
</p>
<p>
No one was shown this letter, but Frances insisted
upon walking to the Corners with it that
night, to get it out on the first early morning
mail to New York.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s all walk to the store with Frans,” suggested
Janet, jumping up to show her readiness
to go.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
“That will give me the chance to get some
slips that Mrs. Tompkins promised us the other
day,” added Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“And we can introduce Norma, Belle, and
Frances to Nancy Sherman and Hester Tompkins,”
added Janet.
</p>
<p>
So the girls hastily arranged their hair and
started out, with Mrs. James to escort them.
The country road was very alluring in the twilight,
but there were no gorgeous colors from a
flaring sunset that evening, as the grey overcast
sky had continued all day.
</p>
<p>
They tramped along the foot-path that ran beside
the road and Norma said jokingly: “When
we hiked this from the station we never dreamed
we would be retracing our steps so soon.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems almost as if we had been at Green
Hill a month, doesn’t it?” said Frances.
</p>
<p>
Just at this moment Janet gave a sudden gasp.
“Oh me, oh my! I must run right back home,
girls!”
</p>
<p>
“What for? What’s happened?” asked four
anxious voices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>oh</em>, <span class='sc'>oh</span>! It isn’t what’s happened,—it’s
what I forgot to do!”
</p>
<p>
“But what? Can’t you confide in us?” urged
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I forgot all about those pesky chickens. I
never fed them to-night, nor did I give them
fresh water. I’ve got to do it before it is too
late.”
</p>
<p>
Everyone laughed, but Mrs. James said:
“You’re too late already, Janet. Chickens go to
roost before twilight. You will not get them to
eat or drink to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me! Then they will grow so thin I’ll
never be able to enter them in a County Fair!”
said Janet whimsically.
</p>
<p>
“You never hinted that that was your ambition,”
laughed Natalie. “You started out to do
a thriving business with eggs and broilers.”
</p>
<p>
“I can do that, too, can’t I? But there is
nothing to prevent me from trying for a cash
prize in some Poultry Show this fall, either,” explained
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“If I start a business of any kind, you won’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
find me neglecting it like that!” bragged
Norma.
</p>
<p>
“Wait until you start one—then talk!” retorted
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“How are your vegetables growing to-night,
Nat?” said Belle teasingly. “Almost
ready to ship to Washington Market?”
</p>
<p>
“Instead of laughing at Janet, or my investments,
why don’t you do something yourselves?”
demanded Natalie scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“We would love to, but what is there left for
us to do?” returned Norma.
</p>
<p>
“Surely you don’t think vegetables and stock-raising
compose all the industries in the world,
do you?” laughed Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“No, not in a city; but on a farm, what else
can one do?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I always thought there was a wonderful
opportunity for some ambitious girl to raise
flowers and send in bouquets to the city every
morning,” suggested Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Bouquets! Who to?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
The other girls were listening attentively, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
they had never thought of such a possibility before.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Marvin said the flowers he cut back of
the house, the day he came up here, brightened
his office for many a day. I am convinced that
many hard-working business men downtown
would lean back in their swivel chairs and smile
at a handful of homely country flowers on their
desks, if they but had them. Think of the scores
of troubled, rushing men in the financial districts
of New York, who would stop a minute in their
mad race for success to think of their boyhood
home, should a rose give forth its perfume on his
desk? Think of the peaceful rural picture a few
flowers in a glass on the desk might bring to a
jaded man who never takes time to dream of his
old home.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James’ words created a vision that was
most effective with the girls. After a few moments
of silence, Norma said softly: “I’d love to
do just that thing, Mrs. James.”
</p>
<p>
“But you haven’t any flowers to start with,”
said Belle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why can’t I start some just as Nat did her
vegetables, if I go right at it now?” demanded
Norma.
</p>
<p>
“Norma, Mrs. Tompkins promised me some
petunia plants, and asters, and sweet-peas, and
other slips, if I wanted to use them in the flower
gardens. I really didn’t want them but I hated
to refuse her, as she is so fond of flowers she
thinks everyone else must be, also. Now, this is
your opportunity!” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“You take the plants and slips she offers, and
by judicious praise you will urge her to talk
about her gardens. In this way, you can find
out more about raising flowers than if you
had a book on the subject. I never saw such
gorgeous blossoms as she has,” said Natalie
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“When she finds she has a really interested
florist who intends doing the work properly, she
may give Norma more slips than Natalie could
draw from her,” suggested Frances.
</p>
<p>
“At any rate, we need plenty of flowers
around the place to make it look attractive, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
Norma’s plan will beautify the grounds as well
as give her her profession,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
When they arrived at the Corners Frances
mailed her letter; and Norma, with Mrs. James,
stopped in to see Mrs. Tompkins and her flower
gardens; but the other girls went to Nancy Sherman’s
house to plan about the Patrol meetings.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Tompkins was delighted to have visitors
who were interested in flowers, and when Norma
was ready to join the girls to go home, she carried
a huge market basket filled with all sorts of
plants,—from a delicate lily to a briar-rose.
</p>
<p>
As they trudged along the dark road, Norma
said: “I suppose it will be too dark when we get
home to plant the flowers to-night, Mrs.
James?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes; but you can get up before the sun
in the morning and have the planting done before
the heat of the day,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Tompkins told me to place inverted
flower-pots over all the young plants during the
middle of the day, until they began to perk up
their heads. That would show they had taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
new root in the soil to which they had been transplanted.
But the rose-bush and lily I must
plant in a sheltered spot and shade them with a
screen for a week or more. They would always
freshen up at night but would droop during the
day unless I did this,” explained Norma.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder how long it will be before those
little things have flowers?” said Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Tompkins told me that they would
bud in two weeks at least. I mean, the portulaca
and heliotrope and other old-fashioned
plants she dug up for me. You see, they were already
started in her garden, and this transplanting
will only set them back a few days, she said.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you can begin to figure on an income
in a month’s time, at the very latest,” teased
Belle.
</p>
<p>
Norma made no reply to this laughing remark,
but she was determined to show Belle that perseverance
and persistence were great things that
made for success.
</p>
<p>
It was past nine when the girls reached Green
Hill Farm. As they entered the side gate they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
heard strange sounds coming from the barnyard.
Everyone glanced at Janet to inquire the cause
of the sounds.
</p>
<p>
“It sounds just like those piggies. What can
they be squealing for at this hour?” said Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
Janet looked guilty, but she said nothing.
However, as soon as they reached the side piazza,
she hurried on past the kitchen door and made
for the barn.
</p>
<p>
Rachel heard the arrival and came out on the
piazza. “Mis’ James, dem pigs ain’t kep’ still
all night. I guv ’em some hot mush at six o’clock
’cause Janet fergot to feed ’em. But I ain’t
goin’ to be no nuss-gal to any porkers when I’se
got my house-wuk to look affer. Ef I wuz goin’
to raise hogs, I’d raise ’em, but I ain’t goin’ to
do it fer no one else, nohow.”
</p>
<p>
Everyone laughed appreciatively, and Mrs.
James added: “Janet told us she had forgotten
the chickens to-night. But I told her there was
no use in her returning home, then, as fowl went
to roost with the sun, and would not want to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
bothered again. I was not aware the pigs had
been forgotten, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Wall, I kin tell her what ails ’em, but I jes’
thought I’d let her try to fin’ it out herself.
Mebbe she’ll take a little interest in her business
if she is left to do the wuk!” declared Rachel.
</p>
<p>
“What makes them squeal, Rachel? You can
tell us, can’t you?” coaxed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Well den, dey ain’t got no beddin’ to sleep
on, an’ t’ dish wid water is be’n upsot all evenin’,
so dey ain’t got no drinkin’ water. Young pigs
drink an orful lot of water an’ dey has to have
good beddin’ to sleep on, or dey’ll squeal.”
</p>
<p>
After this explanation, the other girls were
eager to go to the pig-pen and see what Janet
was doing for the comfort of her investment.
Natalie ran indoors and got an electric flashlight,
and they all started for the barnyard,
Rachel bringing up the rear.
</p>
<p>
Poor Janet was ready to scream, when they
found her trying to hush the pigs. She would
try to catch first one, then another to see if anything
had happened to them, but they kept her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
jumping around the pen without her fingers ever
touching their little pink hides.
</p>
<p>
After Mrs. James explained the cause of their
rioting, Janet crawled over the closely-fitted
laths that fenced them in; and all the girls started
for the barn to find some fresh straw for a bed.
Water had been given them, and the avidity with
which they drank it showed how thirsty they had
been.
</p>
<p>
When the bed was made up in the little house,
the three weary little fellows ran in and were
soon curled up to sleep. Then the girls followed
Rachel back to the house, Janet listening very
humbly to her discourse on “Cruelty to Domestic
Animals.”
</p>
<p>
Early in the morning Norma was up, and
without disturbing anyone, slipped down-stairs
and started to work on the flower beds. She had
listened so earnestly to Mrs. Tompkins’ advice
about digging and fertilizing the soil, that she
had finished the narrow beds that edged the house
before the other girls came down.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Norma, you certainly are industrious,” said Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
James, when she saw all that had
been accomplished.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it fun, Mrs. James! I never dreamed
how nice it is to be a farmer. But I never want
to be anything else, now.”
</p>
<p>
Belle laughed, for she was too dignified and
superior to ever think of farm-work. Natalie
watched Norma rake over the roundel that was
the center of the turn-around in the drive from
the road, and then remarked: “Where did you
find the compost, Norma?”
</p>
<p>
Norma looked up and smiled. “Mrs. Tompkins
told me how to mix the fertilizer found in a
barnyard, and so I did. But I found some in a
box over there by the vegetable gardens and I
used some of that, too.”
</p>
<p>
“If I didn’t have to go and look after my
vegetable gardens, Norma, I’d help you plant
the flowers,” said Natalie. “But duty calls me,
so I must obey.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll help Norma plant the slips,” offered
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Your duty is calling you with a louder voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
than Natalie’s ever could,” laughed Belle, holding
up a finger to attract attention to the pig-pen.
</p>
<p>
The girls laughed, and Janet sighed. “I suppose
it will be pigs, pigs, pigs all summer, whenever
I have anything else I wish to do. Even
that old hen misbehaves, and gets off the nest
every time I examine the eggs to see if they are
being pecked.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie had started for her garden by this
time, but when she reached the low dividing fence
at the end of the grass plat back of the kitchen,
she screamed furiously and ran for her precious
vegetables.
</p>
<p>
The other girls turned and ran over to see what
had happened. Natalie was shooing the young
chicks away from her tender green sprouts, but
she dared not tramp upon her beds, so the broilers
ran a few feet away and then stood eyeing
her. They, seemingly, were but waiting for her
to go away so they could resume their breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“That’s because Janet forgot to feed them last
night for supper. Now all my young beets are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
eaten off the top! How can we ever raise anything
to eat or sell, if her old pesky chickens
keep this up!” wailed Natalie, examining the
beets.
</p>
<p>
“They only managed to get a few of them,
Nat! Thank your stars you got here when you
did,” remarked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“I just bet it was those same horrid birds that
destroyed my garden before! I never saw a crow
after that, and I thought I had frightened them
away with the scarecrow. But now, I’m sure
it was the broilers!” declared Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“What a lot of satisfaction it will be to pick
their bones,” suggested Frances. That made
them all laugh and put Natalie in a better humor.
Janet was wise enough to remain at her work
with the pigs and chickens, and not venture near
Natalie that morning.
</p>
<p>
At breakfast Natalie opened the subject.
“Janet, you’ve got to keep those chickens in a
yard. If they get into my garden again, I’m going
to wring their necks and stew them for dinner!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait until they have a little more to them
than skin and bone,” laughed Janet.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll make soup—if nothing more,”
snapped Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I was about to say, Janet, that you might
get some wire-netting at the Corners, such as is
used for runways for chickens,” suggested Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“How much will it cost? I can’t spend more
than my allowance, you know,” answered
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“I have a letter here, in reply to one I wrote
Mr. Marvin, saying I was to use my own good
judgment about the out-buildings. I wrote him
that we ought to repair the coops and pens, as
well as the barns, as soon as possible. And he
says we can get whatever material we need for
slight repairs at the Corners. He opened an account
for us with Si Tompkins and this wire can
be charged to that.”
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t see why you should pay for my
chicken run, Mrs. James?” said Janet.
</p>
<p>
“We are going to repair it, anyway, whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
you keep chickens in it, or someone else does it.
If you are willing to help with the work to be
done on it, we will consider it squared on the cost
of the wire-netting and nails,” explained Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go to the Corners right after breakfast
and get the wire. Maybe I can find someone to
drive me home again, so I won’t have to carry the
awkward roll,” said Janet eagerly.
</p>
<p>
Norma was too busy with her flowers to join
the other girls after breakfast, and Natalie said
she saw some weeds growing up in her garden
beds so she would have to get after them. Janet
and Belle and Frances, therefore, started for the
store, planning to help carry the roll of wire back
home.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James assisted Rachel with the housework
as it was cleaning-day, and so everyone was
engaged when an automobile stopped in front of
the house.
</p>
<p>
Norma Evaston was carefully patting down
the soil about a geranium plant when a shadow
fell across it. She glanced up, and started in surprise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
when she saw Mr. Lowden smiling down at
her.
</p>
<p>
“Good-morning, Norma. I thought to find
Frances here, too, so I crept up the walk to surprise
her,” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how did you get here? There isn’t a
train until eleven,” returned Norma wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“We came in the machine. Mrs. Lowden and
I are going to leave it here for you to use this
summer, so we thought it best to drive out and
go back later by the train.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mr. Lowden! Frans only mailed that
letter last night! How could you have received
it already and driven here?” Norma puckered
her brow as she tried to figure out what time the
letter could have arrived in the city that morning,
if it left Greenville at six o’clock.
</p>
<p>
“What letter?” It was now Mr. Lowden’s
turn to be surprised.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, didn’t you know Frances wanted the car
to use all summer as an investment?” asked
Norma innocently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
“As an investment! What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and we think it will be great fun, too,”
returned Norma eagerly. “You see, I am going
in for flowers to sell to tired homesick financiers
downtown in New York. One sniff of a sprig of
heliotrope or the cheerful nod of a pink standing
in a glass of water on his desk will refresh one
so that he will start out like a new man!
</p>
<p>
“Nat is raising vegetables. She has all the
greens up above the ground already, but those
hungry chickens ate off a number of her best
ones, so that makes them look a bit messy just
now. However, they will soon recover and grow
as good as ever. The household will buy all its
vegetables from her, and Solomon’s Seal Patrol
expect to buy theirs from her, too.
</p>
<p>
“Janet went in for stock-farming. She only
has a few pigs and the chickens as yet, but there
are plenty of other things to get, as her allowance
comes due. She is now planning to buy
some guinea-hens, a flock of geese, some bees for
honey, a few pigeons so we can have squabs, and
other stock as time rolls by.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
</p>
<p>
“But Frances chose to go into the service business.
She is going to run an auto-bus from the
station to the different destinations, and when
we girls wish to take a pleasure-ride in the
country, we all expect to pay a just price for the
use of the car. By fall, Frans ought to have
saved quite a sum of money, don’t you think so?”
</p>
<p>
Norma had talked so fast that Mr. Lowden
could not have said a word had he wanted to; but
he listened with face growing redder and redder,
and when Norma concluded her amazing explanation
he burst out laughing loud and long. His
wife heard the mirth as she sat in the car waiting
to learn if he had found the right place. Now
she jumped out of the tonneau and ran over.
</p>
<p>
Norma sat back on her feet gazing up at the
breathless man, when Mrs. Lowden joined the
two. He tried to sober down enough to explain,
but he spoke in gasps.
</p>
<p>
“Natalie raises vegetables for Solomon; Janet
has turned stock-broker—her stock breaks down
all of Natalie’s greens. Norma here is the philanthropist
of the crowd,—she is about to raise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
flowers for heart-sick financiers. But our
Frances is the Shylock of the party. She is going
to charge fees for the use of an automobile
that costs her nothing! What do you think of
your daughter, now, Mabel?” And he laughed
again, so heartily that Rachel came out to see
who was with Norma.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James soon followed Rachel, and the
Lowdens were welcomed by the hostess. Norma
could not stop her work long enough to sit down
on the piazza and visit, but she sent this advice
after Mr. Lowden as he was about to mount the
porch-steps:
</p>
<p>
“Janet went to the Corners for chicken-wire
and you can do the girls a great favor by going
for them with the car. Belle and Frances went
with Jan, to take turns carrying the roll. But
I guess it is going to be awfully heavy for
them!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lowden then excused himself for a time,
and left his wife with Mrs. James. He soon had
the car speeding along the road that went to the
Corners, and Norma felt she had done her friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
a good turn. But she never dreamed that
Frances had not mentioned the automobile as a
money-maker for that summer.
</p>
<p>
When the machine came back with the girls
and their roll of wire-netting, Frances looked
disconsolate. Norma was wondering whether
her father had refused her the car for business
purposes, and so she stopped planting long
enough to join the party on the piazza.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think, Norma? Dad says I
have to be sixteen before I can have a license to
drive a jitney. If I drive without one, that old
lazy Amity Parsons will arrest me. And if I
use someone else’s license, I can be heavily fined.
That explodes all my ambition!” exclaimed
Frances woefully.
</p>
<p>
But Janet came to the rescue, as usual. “Say,
Mr. Lowden, Frans can drive the car without a
license if she has someone in the seat beside her
who <em>does</em> have a regular license.”
</p>
<p>
“Who can I have?” demanded Frances.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know! I haven’t thought of
that, yet!” admitted Janet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
</p>
<p>
“I can drive a car, so there is no excuse why
I should not be able to secure one,” said Mrs.
James thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“The main point is—we’ve got the car here to
use for the summer, and the other points can be
covered as we reach them,” remarked Janet.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lowden laughed again, for all this business
ambition was highly amusing to him. But
he had no objections to the automobile remaining
at Green Hill Farm during his absence in
the west, and the girls all breathed easier when
they heard his verdict.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can argue out the question about
a jitney license, but I must go back to my flowers,”
said Norma, getting up from the steps and
starting for the roundel.
</p>
<p>
“And I must start work on that chicken-fencing.
If it is to be done before nightfall, I must
ask help, too,” said Janet, beckoning Belle to
help her carry the roll of wire.
</p>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Lowden were invited to stay to
dinner but they declined with regrets, as they
were to be back in New York soon after noon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
Then Frances said: “I’ll have to drive you to
the station to catch the only train that stops at
Greenville this afternoon, and how will I get
back if I haven’t a license?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll accompany you, Frances, and later we
will have to plan a way out of the difficulty,”
said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
Good-bys were said, and the girls stood on the
piazza waiting to see the car start off, when
Rachel came out. “Hey, Mis’ James! I got it!
Jes’ hol’ up a minit, will yuh?”
</p>
<p>
She hurried down the walk and ran out of the
gate to lay her plan before the owners of the
automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Yuh all knows my nephew Sam in Noo
York? Well, he got a shover’s license las’ spring
cuz he figgered on drivin’ somebody’s car this
summer in the country. But we all know what
a easy-goin’ darky he is, too!
</p>
<p>
“He diden have ambichun enough to hunt out
a place, so he jes’ waited fer a plum to drap in
his mout’. Ef he is in Noo York, he’ll be at dis
address, sure! Ef I tells him to come out heah,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
widdout fail, to run dat car, he’ll come quick as
lightnin’. Ef us gives him room an’ board, he
oughter be glad fer the chants. Den no one kin
pester Mis’ Francie ’bout license, er nuttin. An’
Sam kin make hisself useful to me by bringin’ in
coal an’ wood fer t’ kitchen fire, an’ doin’ odd
jobs about t’ place.”
</p>
<p>
This information seemed to suit Mr. Lowden
exactly, and he turned to Rachel to say: “I’ll
find him, Rachel, never fear—if he is to be found
in the city. Look for him in the next day or
two.”
</p>
<p>
Then saying good-by again, they drove away.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—GRIT INVITES HIMSELF TO GREEN HILL</h2>
<p>
The vegetables, animals, and flowers might
have experienced gross neglect during the next
few days, after the automobile arrived, had it
not been for Mrs. James’ insistence that “duty
came before pleasure.” Even so, Natalie spent
no time weeding the beds but gave the “farmer’s
curse” ample opportunity to thrive luxuriantly.
</p>
<p>
The third day after the Lowdens had promised
to hunt up Sam and send him to Green Hill
Farm, a most unique post-card came for Rachel.
It had the picture of the Woolworth Building
on one side, and the information that this was a
“gift card” given to those who visited the tower.
On the side with the address, Sam printed with
lead-pencil, “Deer ant: wurd cam fer me to be
shoffer at yur place. Money O. K. comin rite
away. sam.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
</p>
<p>
This elaborate epistle was displayed by Rachel
with so much family pride that the girls had hard
work to keep straight faces. But they knew how
hurt Rachel would be if she thought the writing
was illiterate, so they said nothing.
</p>
<p>
“If that card was mailed yesterday, as the
postmark shows it was, Sam ought to be here to-day,”
said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but he won’t get here in time to drive
us to Ames’s farm for the guinea-hens,” said
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“As that will be my last act of law-breaking,
I’ll drive,” announced Frances.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the girls hurried away in the car.
They had not gone more than half the distance
to Dorothy Ames’s home, when Natalie saw a
dog following the machine.
</p>
<p>
“Go home, old fellow!” called she, waving her
hat to drive him back.
</p>
<p>
But the dog stood momentarily still and
wagged his stumpy tail, then galloped after the
car again, to make up for lost time.
</p>
<p>
“Girls, what shall we do with that dog?” cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
Natalie in distress. “If he follows us much further
he may get lost.”
</p>
<p>
Frances stopped the car and called the dog to
her. He stood with front paws on the running-board
and looked up at her with happy
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a fine Collie, girls. Look at his head
and the lines of his body. Someone get out and
look at the collar for the owner’s name,” said
Frances, leaning over to study the dog.
</p>
<p>
Belle got out and having examined the collar,
remarked: “No name on it. It’s just a plain
leather affair with a frayed rope-end still attached
to the ring.”
</p>
<p>
The dog gave a short friendly yelp at Belle
and wagged his tail rapidly, as a token of good
fellowship.
</p>
<p>
“Let him run after us if he wants to, then we
will take him back with us when we return,” suggested
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“We’d better have him jump inside the car,
then, so he won’t stray while our attentions are
turned,” ventured Norma.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
</p>
<p>
So the dog was given room in the tonneau
where he stood and watched over the side of the
machine as they flew along the road.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Dorothy Ames’s farm, he waited
until the door was opened, then he leaped out and
pranced about the girls.
</p>
<p>
“That’s some dog you girls got there!” declared
Mr. Ames, as he came forward to welcome
his visitors.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he must belong to someone living near
Green Hill. He ran after our car as we turned
from the state road into this road,” explained
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t never seen him about afore. I knows
every dog fer ten mile around Greenville, and
there hain’t no farmer that kin afford a’ animal
like that,” returned Mr. Ames.
</p>
<p>
“Why—is he a good one?” wondered
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“Got every point a prize-winnin’ Collie
ought to have. I wish he was my dog! I’d win a
blue ribbon on him,” said Mr. Ames, as he examined
the dog critically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then someone will worry until he is home
again,” said Norma concernedly.
</p>
<p>
The dog seemed not to worry, however, for
he yawned and followed the girls about as if he
had known them since puppyhood. Mr. Ames
told the girls that the dog must be about two
years old, and certainly showed he had been accustomed
to a good living.
</p>
<p>
The guinea-hens were selected, several pigeons
ordered to be delivered in a few days when the
house would be ready, and a number of young
goslings spoken for. Janet was not going to lose
time planning for a stock-farm business and not
act, it seemed.
</p>
<p>
“If you gals are going to take the dog
back the way he came, you’d better not try to
take the crate with the hens, too. I’ll leave
them on my way to the Corners,” advised Mr.
Ames.
</p>
<p>
The business matters settled, Frances spoke
of her new line of work. “If you folks ever want
to rent a car for a trip, or when you want to go
to the station, just call me on the ’phone and I’ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
come for you. I am starting a jitney-line and
am always on hand for my clients.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames laughed and said: “Sort of runnin’
opposition to Amity, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, not opposition, exactly, as Amity is
never about to attend to business. But I intend
running the car faithfully, as anyone who is in
the public service should do,” said Frances.
</p>
<p>
“What about a license?” questioned the
farmer wisely.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s taken care of. My chauffeur, Sam
White, is going to drive the machine, while I act
as conductor.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames laughed again, heartier than ever,
and Dorothy smiled sympathetically at Frances.
Then she said: “I wish I had something to do
besides churning butter and working on the
farm.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Dorothy, just you stick to us Girl
Scouts and we’ll find you some desirable field of
labor,” said Janet encouragingly.
</p>
<p>
Soon after this the girls started homeward, the
dog jumping in without being invited and sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
up in the place provided him before. The girls
patted him and said he was a clever fellow. That
started his tail wagging violently and his tongue
panting with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
At Green Hill, Mrs. James watched the girls
stop at the side piazza, and then, to her surprise,
she saw the dog jump out of the car. He stood
waiting for his companions to alight and then he
sprang up the steps and wagged his tail at
her.
</p>
<p>
“What a fine dog,” said Mrs. James, patting
his head. “Whose is he?”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know, Jimmy. He just followed
us after we left the state road. Mr. Ames says
he doesn’t belong to anyone around here, ’cause
he knows every dog in the county,” answered
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“He must have lost his way, then. Maybe he
was with a party of autoists who passed that
way. They will surely come back to hunt for
him, so we had better hang a large sign out on the
tree by the front gate,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good plan,” assented Natalie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
“I’ll run in and get a cardboard box and print
the sign.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t describe the dog,—just say we found a
strayed canine,” advised Janet.
</p>
<p>
“If no one comes for him, we may as well keep
him until we determine what to do about it,”
added Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“We must find a name for him, too. What
do you suppose he was called?” asked Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“If we knew that, we might have a clue to his
owners,” laughed Janet.
</p>
<p>
“The best way to name him is this way,” suggested
Natalie. “Let each one write a name on
a slip of paper and fold it up. Rachel shall deal
out the votes and the last one out of the box shall
be his name. How is that?”
</p>
<p>
“Good! Run and get the paper, Nat,”
laughed Janet.
</p>
<p>
So in a few moments six slips of paper were
cut and handed out. The pencil was passed
around and everyone wrote her choice of a name
for the dog. Rachel was called out to collect the
votes in an old hat, and when they were well
shaken she removed them, one by one, until the
last one was taken up.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<img src="images/illus-267.jpg" alt="Mrs. James leaned over to see who was coming in." title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>Mrs. James leaned over to see who was coming in.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>
She opened it slowly and spelled out carefully:
“G-r-i-t.”
</p>
<p>
“Ho, <em>Grit,</em> that is my choice!” shouted Natalie,
clapping her hands. As if the dog was
pleased with his name, he jumped around madly
and barked shrilly.
</p>
<p>
“He seems to like his name,” said Janet,
laughing at the way the animal tried to lick
Natalie’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it sounds something like his real one,”
suggested Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Wall, whatever it is, I says he oughter have
a pan of water to drink. Affer all dis excitement
he needs refreshin’,” remarked Rachel, going
to the kitchen and calling the dog to follow
her.
</p>
<p>
He went obediently, and just as the girls began
to plan the sign, and what to write thereon,
the gate clicked. Mrs. James leaned over the
piazza rail to see who was coming in, and saw a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
short, fat, colored youth of about eighteen, approaching.
</p>
<p>
“It must be Sam,—Rachel’s nephew,” whispered
Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
The expected chauffeur saw the party on the
piazza and removed his cap politely, but his face
expressed trouble, and he sighed as he stopped at
the foot of the steps.
</p>
<p>
“You are Sam, aren’t you?” began Mrs.
James.
</p>
<p>
“Yas’m, an’ I would huv be’n here long ago,
as I writ, but I lost my bes’ friend and be’n
huntin’ him fer more’n an hour.” Again Sam
sighed heavily and his eyes were moist.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a pity!” exclaimed Mrs. James.
“How did it happen, Sam?”
</p>
<p>
“Wall, yuh see, Ma’am, I brung him on the
baggidge car tied to a rope, an’ when we got off
at the Statchun he was that glad to see the green
grass and fresh air that he galavanted ’round like
a crazy thing. He tuk it inter his head to chase
a bird what flied low along the road, and I laffed
as I follered after him. But I lost sight of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
him, down the road, until I got to the Corners.
I diden know what way to take there, so I went
the most travelled one.
</p>
<p>
“That’s where I made my mistake. I should
hev asked the storekeeper the way to Green Hill.
I whistled and called fer a mile, er more, but
Grip never showed up. Then I got afraid he
was really lost. I turned back and asked the
man at the Corners ef he saw’d a dog run by, an’
he said, ‘Yeh, the mutt was chasin’ down the
road to Green Hill Farm.’
</p>
<p>
“I got mad at him fer callin’ Grip a mutt, but
I hurried along the road he pointed out. I kep’
on goin’ and callin’, an’ went right by this place
widdout knowin’ it. When I came to a farm
owned by a man called Ames—a mile down the
road,—he tol’ me I was too far. So I come back
again. But I hain’t seen no sound of Grip
sence.” A heavy sigh escaped Sam and he drew
his sleeve across his wet eyes.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the sound of the voice reached Grit—or
Grip—in the kitchen, or perhaps his canine instinct
told him his master was there,—whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
it was, he came bounding out of the house and
leaped upon Sam with such force that the little
fellow was rolled over backward upon the soft
grass.
</p>
<p>
Grip pawed and rolled over again in his joy at
seeing his master again, and the girls stood and
shouted aloud with amusement at the scene.
When Grip’s violent expression of welcome had
somewhat quieted down, Mrs. James said:
</p>
<p>
“This certainly is a good ending to our adventure.”
</p>
<p>
Then she proceeded to tell Sam how the girls
found Grip on the road, and how fortunate it
was that no other tourists had taken him in.
</p>
<p>
Rachel heard a familiar voice and now came
hurrying from her kitchen. “Wall, of all
things! Ef it ain’t Sambo! How’de, my son?”
exclaimed she, enfolding the little man in her
capacious arms.
</p>
<p>
“You talk as ef you hadn’t looked fer me?”
grinned Sam, endeavoring to free himself from
the close embrace.
</p>
<p>
“I’m that glad to see yoh, Chile! I felt sort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
o’ fearsome ’bout leavin’ yoh all alone in a wicked
city widdout me near to advise yoh dis summer,”
returned Rachel, beaming joyously upon her kin.
</p>
<p>
Sam laughed, and then the story of Grip was
told in a most graphic manner, the girls interrupting
to add some forgotten item.
</p>
<p>
“Laws’ee! Ain’t dat a plain case o’ Providence
fer us? An’ to think how Natalie called
the dawg Grit, too!”
</p>
<p>
“Now that all this excitement is ended, suppose
you business girls go and attend to your
work,” suggested Mrs. James. “While you
were away I walked over to the vegetable garden
and was horrified to find so many weeds growing
taller than the plants we are trying to coax along.
And Janet’s investment has escaped from the
pen and given Rachel and me the race of our
lives. After half an hour’s heated chase we captured
the pigs, but the chickens are still at large,
scratching Norma’s flower slips out of the
ground. I have shouted at them, and driven
them away repeatedly, but I see they are back
there again.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
</p>
<p>
No more needed to be said then, and in a minute’s
time three excited girls were wildly racing
to their various places of work to repair the damages
made in their investments.
</p>
<p>
Then Sam was shown his room in the attic,
where he could unpack his fabrikoid suit-case and
don his farm-clothes. It was plainly evident that
he liked the idea of living in the country and
driving a car when called upon, and Mrs. James
considered the girls were most fortunate to have
Rachel’s own relative—to say nothing of the dog—on
the place that summer.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames drove by before noon and left the
crate with the guinea-hens and pigeons, and
Janet eagerly began work on a separate coop for
the hens. Sam offered to help build the pigeon-coop
on the gable end of the carriage-house,
where the birds could alight without molestation.
</p>
<p>
But the story of Janet’s stock-farm and how
she succeeded is told in another book and can be
given no extra room in this story. Suffice it to
say, she certainly had troubles of her own in trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
to raise a barnyard full of different domestic
animals; and had it not been for Sam’s ever-willing
help in catching the runaways or repairing
the demolished fences, the result would not have
been quite so good.
</p>
<p>
That evening, as they all sat on the side steps
of the piazza watching the far-reaching fingers
of red that shot up from the western sky, Belle
spoke plaintively:
</p>
<p>
“I feel like a laggard, with you girls all working
so hard at some business. Nat with her garden,
Janet with the barnyard, Norma with the
flowers, and Frans with her jitney—what is there
for me to do? I hate dirt and animals, and I
haven’t any car,—so what <em>is</em> left for me?” she
sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you turn your attention to Scout
study?” asked Natalie, feeling that they had
neglected Solomon’s Seal Camp lately.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want that kind of work,—I want a
real business, like you girls have,—but what is
there to do?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll just have to pray and wait for an answer,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
suggested Norma, the devout one of the
group.
</p>
<p>
“Is that what you did before the flowers came
your way from Mrs. Tompkins?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“No, but you see, I always pray and hope for
an answer, so I don’t have to lose time when
something comes to me. It is always coming at
the right moment, so I never have to ask especially
for any one thing,” explained Norma seriously.
</p>
<p>
Belle laughed softly. “I wish you’d do it for
me, Norma.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Belle! You know how to ask for
yourself! You’ll get it all the sooner if you stop
laughing and try my plan,” rebuked Norma.
</p>
<p>
The talk suddenly changed at this point, and
no one thought more of Norma’s advice to Belle.
But the latter was duly impressed by Norma’s
faith, and determined to try secretly a prayer or
two in her own behalf. So that evening after
she had retired, she earnestly asked that a way
might be shown her to occupy herself that summer
even as her friends were doing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
</p>
<p>
The following morning Sam suggested that
the car meet the three daily trains from the city,
to carry any passengers to their destinations.
As it took but a short time to drive to the station
and back, this plan was agreed upon. Frances
would act as conductor of the fares and direct
Sam the way to go when taking a passenger
home.
</p>
<p>
On the morning trip they would bring back the
mail and any orders that might be needed for the
house or the Scout camp. In the afternoon the
trip would be made for passenger service only,
and at evening the mail would be brought
back, or any purchases needed at Tompkins’
store.
</p>
<p>
The initial trip was made that morning at
nine-thirty, the girls wishing Frances all success
in her new venture. As the car disappeared
down the road Natalie hurried to her garden to
go to work on the weeding.
</p>
<p>
Janet went to the farmyard to begin building
some sort of shelter for a calf she purposed buying
from Mr. Ames. And Norma began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
plant seeds in her flower beds. Mrs. James
went in to help Rachel, and Belle was left alone
on the porch to plan various things to interest
herself, also.
</p>
<p>
As she rocked nervously, trying to think of
something agreeable to do, she heard Natalie cry
loudly from the garden. She sprang from the
porch and ran down the path to render any help
possible to the friend in distress, and saw Natalie
jumping up and down, with skirts held high and
close about her form.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! Belle,—bring a rock! Get a gun—anything—quick!”
yelled Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“What for—what’s the matter?” shouted
Belle, looking anxiously about for a stone or a
big stick.
</p>
<p>
“A snake! A great big snake ran out of the
ground and tried to get me!” screamed Natalie,
still jumping up and down.
</p>
<p>
Belle caught up a heavy stone and tried to
carry it quickly to her friend, but she had to drop
it after running a short distance, as it was too
heavy for her. Then she found a smaller stone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
and ran with that to demolish utterly the awful
thing!
</p>
<p>
“Where is it? Where did it go?” cried
Belle excitedly, as she reached the vegetable
beds.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh—it came out of that hole in the corn-hill,
and ran that way!” gasped Natalie, breathless
with her violent exercise.
</p>
<p>
“Out of that hole! Why, that is only as big
as my small finger! How could a great snake
come from there?”
</p>
<p>
“All the same it did! Oh, <em>oh,</em> <span class='sc'>OH</span>! Look,
Belle! There it is,—under that corn-spear!”
shouted Natalie, bending and pointing at the terrifying
(?) object.
</p>
<p>
Belle had to look hard to be able to detect the
little frightened snake. There, curled up under
the tiny spear of green, was a young grass snake
about three inches long. It held up its pretty
striped head and watched fearfully for the huge
rock to fall upon its innocent body.
</p>
<p>
Belle stood upright and gave vent to a loud
laugh. “Oh, Nat! That is only a dear little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
worker in your garden. Why would you kill
a creature that will gobble up your troubles?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” demanded Natalie,
ashamed of her groundless fears.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I’ve read in school that grass snakes,
garter snakes, and even black snakes, are the
farmers’ best friends. They eat cut-worms,
clean off all grubs from plants, and even keep
out moles, beetles, and other pests, that ruin
vegetables.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie bravely turned her back upon the
grass snake at this and wagged her head prophetically:
“All the same, where a young snake like
that can be found there must be a big parent,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Doubtless, but the parent snake can kill off
ten times as many pests as a baby snake, so don’t
go and kill it when it hurries to your cornfield to
catch a field-mouse,” laughed Belle.
</p>
<p>
As Belle started back for the rocking-chair to
continue her mental planning, she saw Frances’
car approach swiftly from the Corners.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goody! She has a passenger!” shouted
Belle to Norma as she ran past the flower beds.
</p>
<p>
Norma dropped her trowel and fork and raced
after Belle to the gate to watch the private jitney
go past. But Sam stopped in front of the gate
and Frances beckoned to the girls.
</p>
<p>
As Belle ran out to see what was wanted of
them, a well-dressed lady, seated in the tonneau,
smiled and said:
</p>
<p>
“I alighted at Greenville by mistake. I was
directed to a country place beyond White Plains,
where I hear I can buy some antiques. I am in
the business in New York, but I haven’t time
now to wait for another train and go on to visit
this lady. Your young friend here thought the
one named Belle might possibly undertake this
commission for me, as she was at liberty to sell
her time. Which of you is Belle?”
</p>
<p>
Belle immediately signified that she was the
one, and the lady continued: “I believe you know
something of antique furniture and china?”
</p>
<p>
“Something—because I started a little collection
of my own at home. I have read many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
books to be had at the Library on the subject and
can tell a Wedgewood jug or bowl or a Staffordshire
plate, as readily as anyone. I also know
the different Colonial period furniture when I
see any.”
</p>
<p>
“Splendid! Then you can act as my agent
up here, if you will. I must get back to keep an
appointment in New York at two o’clock, but
you can hunt up this old farmhouse for me that
is somewhere west of Pleasantville, on a road
that is described accurately on this map,” said the
stranger, as she unfolded a paper and glanced at
it to see that it was the right one. This was
handed to Belle, and the lady continued:
</p>
<p>
“If you find anything there—or at any place
in this section of the country—such as brasses,
dishes, furniture, or pictures, telephone me at my
business address and I will make an appointment
to meet you wherever it is. Will you consider
it?”
</p>
<p>
“I should like nothing better, if you think I
can do it for you,” returned Belle, delighted at
the prospect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think you can, and for this service I will
pay you for the time you actually give to the pursuit.
Also I will pay for the hire of the car, as I
explained to this young lady here.
</p>
<p>
“If you can possibly find time to go to this
house to-day, it will please me greatly, as I want
information about the four-poster canopied bed
I hear is there for sale. Telephone me full particulars
after you come back, will you?”
</p>
<p>
Belle agreed eagerly to the proposition, and
the lady then mentioned the salary she would
pay, by the hour, for this service of Belle’s. Also
Frances mentioned her charge for the use of the
car, which was agreed to without demur.
</p>
<p>
“Now I wish your man would drive me to the
railway station at the nearest point where a train
can be taken without losing more time. I do not
care which town it is, as long as I can get back to
the city before two o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
Belle was left standing speechless on the footpath
as the car drove rapidly away, and Norma
smiled happily. “Did you pray as I told you
to, Belle?” asked she.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh!” was all the reply Norma got, but
she understood Belle’s ways and ran back to her
flowers without another word. Belle walked
slowly toward the house to get her hat and handbag
so as to start on the new venture as soon as
Frances returned from the White Plains railroad
station.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—BELLE’S CHOICE OF A PROFESSION</h2>
<p>
Solomon’s Seal Patrol invited the Tenderfoot
members to their camp on the afternoon before
the Fourth of July to begin their lessons in
scouting. Frances agreed to notify the three
Greenville girls of the invitation and then call
for them at the time appointed.
</p>
<p>
Because of the afternoon to be spent at the
camp, Natalie planned to give her entire morning
to the garden. There had been enough rainfall
at intervals, during the time she had first
started her garden, to keep the plants sufficiently
moist, but for several days, now, the sun had
baked the soil and there had been no sign of a
cloud in the sky.
</p>
<p>
At breakfast that Saturday morning Natalie
spoke of it. “Jimmy, my garden is as dry
as a lime-kiln. What had I better do about
it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
</p>
<p>
“You might try sprinkling it with a hose. I
see there is a hydrant right near the box-hedge—for
that very purpose, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
“I never thought of that! But I will need a
hose,” said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“I saw one in the cellar, Nat, when I was nosing
about for some old flower-pots to cover my
transplanted flowers,” now remarked Norma.
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll get it out right after breakfast, and
see if it will screw onto the hydrant.”
</p>
<p>
Norma went with Natalie as she went down
the outside cellar-steps to the partitioned corner
where the hose had been seen. It was wound on
an old wooden rack that could be carried up to
the grass-plot and turned to unwind the long
piece of rubber.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it great to discover this all ready for
us?” said Natalie delightedly.
</p>
<p>
“With a brass cap on one end to screw it to
the hydrant, too,” added Norma.
</p>
<p>
The other girls gathered around to watch the
two gardeners manipulate the hose, and when it
had been carefully unwound Natalie dragged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
one end over to the hedge to try and screw the
cap to the hydrant.
</p>
<p>
This was soon accomplished, and Norma then
straightened out the length of rubber to allow the
water to flow through it more readily when Natalie
should turn the faucet. As the unexpected
advent of a garden hose was a cause for celebration,
the four girls called to Mrs. James to come
out and watch the sprinkler work.
</p>
<p>
Rachel felt that she must be on the spot also,
so she hurried out, wiping her wet hands on her
apron as she came.
</p>
<p>
“All ready, Nat,—turn on the water!” called
Norma, as she picked up the end with the sprinkler
on it.
</p>
<p>
Natalie turned the brass faucet and instantly
the flow of water swelled the hose out, but there
were many punctures in its length, and one serious
crack, so that the water spurted up through
the holes and made graceful fountains. There
was enough force of water, however, to cause a
fine shower of water to come from the sprinkler,
until suddenly, without warning, a sound as of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
muffled explosion came, and quite near the
sprinkler the rubber burst and shot forth a
stream of water.
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minit, Honey—I’ll run an’ git a
piece of mendin’ tape what I foun’ in my kitchen
closet,” called Rachel, hurrying up the stoop-steps
and disappearing through the doorway.
</p>
<p>
The girls tried to stop the undesired spurt of
water by placing their hands over the crack and
on other holes in the length of the tube. Then
Rachel appeared with the bicycle tape, and was
just coming down the steps when Natalie called
to her.
</p>
<p>
Norma still held the sprinkler in her hand and
now turned to see what Rachel had; in so doing,
she unconsciously turned the end of the hose also,
so that instantly all the girls trying to stop the
leakage were thoroughly sprinkled.
</p>
<p>
Such a screaming and shouting ensued that
Norma instantly turned to see what had happened.
This time the water drenched Mrs.
James, who fled precipitately for the house.
</p>
<p>
Rachel was haw-hawing loudly at the funny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
scene when Norma turned to explain the accident
to the girls. Without warning, the shower
now fell upon Rachel, who had approached
within its radius.
</p>
<p>
But the latter was not as docile about being
soaked as were the girls. She dashed forward,
caught the hose from Norma’s hands and threw
it upon the grass.
</p>
<p>
“Turn dat water off at d’ hydran’, Natalie
Av’rill!” shouted the irate woman.
</p>
<p>
Natalie had been laughing immoderately at
the outcome of the experiment with the hose, but
she quickly obeyed Rachel’s order and turned off
the water.
</p>
<p>
“You thought it was awfully funny, Rachie,
until you got a soaking yourself,” called Natalie,
still giggling.
</p>
<p>
“Me! I wa’n’t mad, a’tall! I jes’ wants to
mend dis pipe, an’ one cain’t do nuthin’ wid
water flyin’ through it at such a rate. Now I
kin wrap dis tape aroun’ it an’ fix it, so’s you kin
water your gardens,” explained Rachel loftily.
</p>
<p>
After this incident the hose was mended and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
Natalie soon had her young vegetables well
watered and left to the mercy of the sun that
day. No one at Green Hill Farm knew enough
to advise her not to water the plants while the
sun was shining upon them, and Natalie fondly
fancied she had done a good thing.
</p>
<p>
Norma sprinkled her flowers well when Natalie
had done with the hose, but the flower beds
were sheltered from the noonday sun, so they did
not fare as badly as did the vegetables.
</p>
<p>
Sam was in the barnyard helping Janet construct
a new shed for the calf which she wanted
to buy the next week, and he was not so well
versed in farm-lore, so Natalie never understood
why all her tender seedlings should wilt so
quickly and seem to dry away before the afternoon
heat.
</p>
<p>
The tomato plants, that had been transplanted
from Mr. Ames’s farm, had grown wonderfully
well, and were large enough to warrant Natalie’s
starting the frames which would be needed when
the red fruit appeared on the vines. So she
planned how to make the best kind of square
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
frame for them, as she loosened the soil about the
potato plants that morning.
</p>
<p>
Her thoughts were so filled with the vision of
the lath frames that she failed to see something
crawling on a tiny leaf of the potato vine where
she was hoeing. When her eye was attracted to
the movement, she gave a slight shudder and
screamed.
</p>
<p>
“Wat’s d’ matter now?” called Rachel from
the kitchen steps.
</p>
<p>
“Ooh! A horrid bug on one of my dear little
potato vines!” cried Natalie, standing still to
watch the crawling beetle.
</p>
<p>
Rachel hurried over to the garden. “Da’s
onny a tater-bug, Honey. Ain’t chew ever hear
tell of tater-bugs? Ef you’se let ’em go, dey will
eat up all your taters in no time.”
</p>
<p>
As she explained, Rachel took the Colorado
beetle between her fat thumb and forefinger and
soon crushed it. Natalie shivered as she watched
the remains flung away, but Rachel meant
business and had no time for dainty shudderings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes she had turned over other
tiny leaves and revealed many bugs eating away
at the juicy food. These were quickly caught
and killed, but a few of them managed to get
away by flying up out of Rachel’s reach.
</p>
<p>
Natalie stood by and watched, and when
Rachel said: “Now you’se kin go on wid dis job.
Ebery vine has to be hunted on and dem tater-bugs
killed off.”
</p>
<p>
“Rachie, I just can’t crush them the way you
do!” complained Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Rachel looked at the girl for a moment, then
said: “Neber mind dis way, Honey. I’ll git
Sam to fix you up a tin can on a stick. You kin
have some kerosene in it and brush dese pests into
t’ can by using a short stick. Dey can’t fly away,
when once dey fall in dat kerosene.”
</p>
<p>
“But Rachel, isn’t there a way to keep the
horrid pests away from my garden?” asked Natalie
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Yeh—we’se will have to squirt Paris Green
or hellebore on the leaves, I rickon,” returned
Rachel thoughtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then tell Frances to buy some next time she
drives past Si Tompkins’ store,” said Natalie,
turning her back on the potato-beds and starting
work on the bean-plants.
</p>
<p>
The weeding had all been finished, and most of
the potato-vines had been cleaned of the beetles,
before the noonday meal was announced to the
busy workers. They were half famished, as was
usual nowadays, and hastened to the house to
wash and clean up before appearing in the dining-room.
</p>
<p>
Frances drove to the Corners and not only got
the powder for Natalie’s plants, but also got the
two girls who were to attend the Scout meeting
that day. Having left them at the house, she
drove on to Ames’s farm for Dorothy.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ames came out of the corn-house when he
saw the car and walked over to speak to Frances.
Dorothy was almost ready, so while there were a
few minutes to fill, Frances told the farmer
about Natalie’s potato-bugs and the powder she
bought.
</p>
<p>
“Tell her to use it when the leaves are damp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
with dew in the mornin’—it has better results
that time. Ef she squirts it on dry, an’ the leaves
are dry, too, the eggs won’t die. It is the wet
paste made on the leaves when the powder melts
in the dew that chokes off the young so they can’t
breathe.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell her what you say,” replied Frances
thankfully.
</p>
<p>
“An’ warn her to keep an eye open fer cutworms,
too, ’cause they will appear about these
times, when beans an’ young vines are becomin’
hearty. I’ve hed many a fine plant of cabbitch
chopped down through the stem, jus’ as it was
goin’ to head.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie was given these advices and felt that
she was being well looked after, with two interested
farmers at hand to keep her right.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon at Solomon’s Seal Patrol Camp
was spent in interesting ways. Miss Mason first
read the principles of the Girl Scouts, then repeated
the motto. Most of the girls knew the
slogan, which they gave in unison, and then said
the pledge aloud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Mason then read the letter from National
Headquarters which was a reply to her
application for a Troop registration. The members
of the first Patrol had heard its news—that
they might begin their ceremonies as a Troop,
because the application had been filed and accepted,
and the registration would soon reach
them.
</p>
<p>
The new Patrol heard this with delight, and
the fact that they were going to be actual members
of a Troop made them feel that they had
become more important to the public than ever,
in the last few minutes.
</p>
<p>
The new Scouts were put through several tests
that afternoon, and were then permitted to watch
the Scouts of Patrol No. 1 do many thrilling
First Aid demonstrations. The afternoon ended
with refreshments, all prepared and served by
the girls. The cakes, wild berries and lemonade
tasted delicious as the girls sat under the great
oak tree and chatted.
</p>
<p>
On the homeward walk, Nancy Sherman said
to Natalie: “There are a few more girls at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
Corners who are crazy to join the Scouts this
summer. But I told them I thought our Patrol
was full. Was that right?”
</p>
<p>
“Who are the girls—and how old are they,
Nancy?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, most of them are about thirteen or fourteen,
but one girl is past fifteen. There are six,
in all, and they say that they know some more
girls who will join when they hear of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Why can’t they start Patrol No. 3, and belong
to this same Troop,” suggested Janet.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what I was thinking,” said Natalie.
</p>
<p>
Then Mrs. James spoke. “Nancy, you invite
all these girls to our farm some day and we will
entertain them. After we have shown them
what we can do in Scout work we will accept
them as candidates, if they consent to become
<em>our</em> Tenderfoot Scouts. In this way, girls, you
all can win the needed test to enroll as a First
Class Scout when the time is at hand.”
</p>
<p>
This was an excellent idea, and the girls felt
greatly encouraged at the hope of being able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
take the examinations as First Class Scouts, of
Patrol No. 2, of Solomon’s Seal Troop.
</p>
<p>
Nancy was entrusted with the invitation to the
girls, and warned to keep secrecy about the plan
to secure the approval as First Class Scouts on
their Tenderfoot training.
</p>
<p>
Sam and the car were nowhere in sight when
the girls reached the house, but Rachel came out
and explained.
</p>
<p>
“A telerphone call come f’om Noo York f’om
dat antique woman, sayin’ fer Belle t’ git dat ol’
chest of drawers oveh by Tarrytown road, right
now. It war to be expressed at onct to her shop
in Noo York, what Belle had an address of, so I
had Sam go along to git it an’ fetch it back so’s
we coul’ pack an’ ship it right off.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Rachel! He need not have done that!
I made all arrangements with a man near there
to get the chest to the railroad station and express
it to the city. I was only awaiting orders,”
exclaimed Belle, annoyed at the way her well-laid
plans were upset.
</p>
<p>
“I wuz thinkin’, Honey, dat mebbe dat man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
would cost somethin’ to do t’ wuk, an’ Sam ain’t
doin’ nuthin’ whiles he’s waitin’ fer orders. So
yuh oughta get dat money foh yo’se’f.”
</p>
<p>
Belle had not thought of this, and now she saw
that Sam and Rachel were planning for her
benefit. But Frances said: “How is he ever
going to carry the chest if it is a big affair?”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t, Frans,” said Belle. “It is a low-boy
that will easily go in the tonneau, and no
harm come to the car.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I think Sam’s plan was good. It
saved you time and expense,” said Mrs. James.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and I must share the charges the man
would have asked me, with Sam,” said Belle.
</p>
<p>
This pleased Rachel immensely,—that her kin
should be commended and given a share in the
profits. She felt amply repaid for all the solicitude
she had felt about the order.
</p>
<p>
The Solomon’s Seal Tenderfoot Scouts had to
walk home that day to the Corners, as Sam was
not expected back in time to drive them home.
The Green Hill girls accompanied their fellow-members
to the gate and watched them depart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
</p>
<p>
That evening Sam told Belle that he would
build her a strong crate from some old wood
found in the barn, and the chest could be taken to
White Plains station early Monday. This plan
would save time, and also the cost of crating and
expressage if done at Tarrytown. So the chauffeur
was highly commended for the suggestion
and told to do it as soon as he could.
</p>
<p>
The experiences of Belle that summer in hunting
antiques in the Westchester Hill farms were
most interesting, but no room can be spared in
this book for the telling of her adventures. So
that must wait for a volume on her exploits.
</p>
<p>
As the next day was Sunday, Natalie did not
do any garden work, but Janet had to attend to
her farmyard stock the same as on week-days.
She grumbled a great deal over the cares and
endless work of a stock-farmer, but the girls noticed
that she was daily planning to add to her
troubles by buying additions.
</p>
<p>
The girls were seated under the large sugar
maple on the side lawn, waiting for Janet to finish
her feeding of the pigs and chickens, when a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
siren was heard. Natalie jumped up and saw a
car approaching along the road. A party of
ladies were with the man who drove the machine.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do believe it is Mr. Marvin, girls!”
called Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“What!” cried Mrs. James in consternation.
“Just look at us all—in our old clothes!”
</p>
<p>
But the automobile was already at the gate,
and the girls found to their delight that he had
brought out their mothers.
</p>
<p>
It seemed like ages since they had seen each
other. The girls talked eagerly of all that had
happened since they came to Green Hill.
Norma showed her flower beds, which really
were looking good. And Belle told about her
antique collecting. Frances displayed with
pride the sum of money already earned with her
private jitney, and Janet took the greatest satisfaction
in escorting her younger sister Helene
and the ladies to the barnyard to see her stock.
Natalie, last of all, showed her gardens, which
looked as neat as a row of pins.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Marvin complimented the girls on all their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
work, and then spoke of the roses in Natalie’s
cheeks and the difference in her general physical
looks.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you are going to stay to dinner,
aren’t you?” ventured Natalie cautiously.
</p>
<p>
“No; we are invited to dine with some friends
quite near Green Hill Farm, but we thought we
ought to stop in and see you before we go on to
our hostess’s place,” said Mr. Marvin.
</p>
<p>
“I never knew you people were acquainted
with anyone around here,” said Janet, wonderingly,
to her mother.
</p>
<p>
“We are, however. A young lady we know
well in the city is summering in Greenville, and
we came to visit her and her family.”
</p>
<p>
Neither of the girls dreamed that Mrs. Wardell
was referring to Miss Mason and her Troop,
so they kept guessing who the acquaintance
might be. Finally Mr. Marvin laughed and told
the secret.
</p>
<p>
Natalie laughed, too, and said: “Well, we certainly
were thick-witted that time. We might
have known it was Miss Mason’s camp.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Marvin could not take his eyes from Natalie,
she was so different from the girl he had
always known in the city. As she told of the
adventures she and the girls had with their “professions”
and the funny experiences with the old
garden hose, her face was so alive with healthy
interest and her eyes sparkled with such fun, that
everyone saw the benefit the country life had
been to her.
</p>
<p>
Later, as they all started for Solomon’s Seal
Camp, Mr. Marvin confided to Mrs. James:
“She is so changed that I do not dread her return
to the city again. She hasn’t spoken one
morbid word, nor seemed pessimistic once, since
I’ve been here.”
</p>
<p>
“She isn’t, either,” admitted Mrs. James.
“Ever since she started work on that garden she
has mentioned nothing that has happened in the
past to cause her sorrow. I sometimes wonder if
she has forgotten it all.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hope so. These mournful remembrances
never do anyone the slightest good.
Don’t revive them in her memory.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—VISITORS AND WELCOME ORDERS</h2>
<p>
That afternoon at the Scout Camp taught the
city visitors many things about the outdoor life
that now interested their girls. Then when it
was time for Mr. Marvin to drive home, he suddenly
remembered something most important.
</p>
<p>
“How could it have slipped my mind?”
said he, as he took several folded papers from his
breast pocket.
</p>
<p>
He adjusted his glasses and read: “Miss
Norma Evaston, Floriculturist, Green Hill,
Greenville, New York.”
</p>
<p>
This long paper was handed to Norma who
opened it with much curiosity. She glanced at
it and then exclaimed in surprise,
</p>
<p>
“Oh, splendid! What does it mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll tell you. I told a few friends of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
your idea of keeping their office desks refreshed
with old-fashioned flowers during the summer,
and each one signified a desire to be placed on
your customer list. So, you see, when the plants
blossom, many of us will expect bouquets.”
</p>
<p>
And then Mr. Marvin handed Belle a paper.
She almost forgot her dignity in her joy.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Marvin authorizes me to find him
an old Colonial secretaire with diamond-paned
glass in the upper doors, and the old urn
and balls crowning the top. I’m sure I
know just where to get such an one!”
</p>
<p>
“I want a mahogany one, Belle, and I am not
particular about the cost, either. The condition
of it will govern the price,” explained the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
Janet frowned over the paper which Mr.
Marvin now gave her. “What’s the matter with
your order, Janet?” asked Helene.
</p>
<p>
“Why, here I have orders for fresh eggs and
broilers every week, and the horrid old hens won’t
lay a single egg. Three of them insist upon setting,
and I can’t keep them away from the nests
that have China decoy eggs in them. The silly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
old things just set on them and chuckle with satisfaction.
If I shoo them away, they make the
<em>most</em> fuss!”
</p>
<p>
Everyone laughed at Janet’s trials, but Mr.
Marvin said, “That order stands good for all
season, Janet. When your hens do begin to
lay, you’ll have to ship the eggs by the car-load.”
</p>
<p>
“How about an order for me?” called Natalie,
seeing a paper in Mr. Marvin’s hand.
</p>
<p>
“‘Last but not least,’” laughed he. “We
have all voted to turn vegetarians after this, just
to order your crops, Natalie. Here is an order
for our winter potatoes, all the sweet corn you
have left to sell, and other fresh things.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie laughed and opened her paper. She
laughed still louder as she read the orders given
her to fill at some future date.
</p>
<p>
Then the city visitors said good-by. As Mr.
Marvin started the engine, he called back over
his shoulder: “A month from to-day I am coming
out with a truck for deliveries.”
</p>
<p>
The girls laughed and waved their hands at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
him, and soon the car was out of sight. Then
they sat down to discuss the marvellous opportunity
given them by Mr. Marvin.
</p>
<p>
After a time, Sam sauntered up to the side
piazza and waited for an opportunity to speak
to Mrs. James. Seeing him anxiously awaiting
his chance, she smiled.
</p>
<p>
“What rests so heavily on your conscience,
Sam?”
</p>
<p>
“I jus’ walked down Miss Natalie’s garden
path to have a look at her wegetables, an’ I see
dem brush peas is ’way up. She oughta get her
brush to-morrer, sure, er she’ll have trouble
makin’ t’ vines cling. Ef she says t’ word, I’ll
go an’ cut down some good brush in t’ woodland
afore she gets up in t’ mornin’ an’ have it ready
to use when she comes out.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sam! Will you, please? I didn’t know
those peas needed anything to hold to. I wasn’t
sure whether I planted the dwarf peas first, or
the climbing variety,” exclaimed Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“That ain’t all, either, Miss Nat,” added Sam
seriously. “I saw you got lima beans planted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
in one bed, an’ no poles on hand fer ’em. Did
you order any bean poles f’om Ames?”
</p>
<p>
“Bean poles! Why, no!” returned Natalie.
</p>
<p>
The girls laughed at her surprise, but Sam
continued:
</p>
<p>
“How did you ’speckt the vines to clim’?”
</p>
<p>
“I never knew they did climb! I thought they
just naturally grew and branched out and bore
beans,” explained Natalie, to the great amusement
of Mrs. James and the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Well, den, I’d better hunt up some decent
poles, too, in t’ woods, eh?” asked Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Would you have to cut down any good
trees?”
</p>
<p>
“I’d choose any what looked sickly, er maybe
some dead young trees. Don’t worry ’bout me
choppin’ down any fine ones.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, Nat, I think it will be fun for us all to
go with Sam in the morning before breakfast,
and help cut the brush and bean poles,” suggested
Janet.
</p>
<p>
“I’m willin’,” said Sam, smiling at the girls.
</p>
<p>
So the five girls went with Sam at sunrise the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
next morning, and by breakfast-time, Natalie
had sufficient poles and brush at her garden beds
to help all the peas and beans she could find room
for that year.
</p>
<p>
The stock-grower and florist, and even the
antiquarian, took such an interest in sticking the
brush into the garden for the peas and helping
the tendrils cling to their new support, that they
left their own tasks undone.
</p>
<p>
Sam had driven Frances in the car to the store
after breakfast, so he was not around when the
girls planted the bean poles. He had not pointed
out the particular bed where the limas were
growing, as he thought, of course, that Natalie
knew. But she had not followed Mrs. James’
advice given a few weeks before, when the seed
was sown—to register each bed with the ticket of
the vegetable that was planted there. Now she
had to depend on her own memory to determine
which of the different plants were beans.
</p>
<p>
The three other girls carried the poles where
she directed, and carefully walked on the
boards Natalie laid down for their feet, to keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
the beds from being trodden while they dug holes
and firmly placed a seven-foot pole in each hill
of beans.
</p>
<p>
“There now, don’t they look business-like?”
exulted Natalie, as she surveyed with pride the
rows of bean poles.
</p>
<p>
Sam stopped the automobile near the side
porch just after Natalie made this remark, and
seeing the girls still at the garden, he hurried
there to see if he could help them in any way.
</p>
<p>
“All done, Sam! Aren’t the poles nice?” exclaimed
Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Yeh, Miss Natalie, the poles is nice enough,
but you ain’t got ’em planted in the lima-bean
garden,” said Sam slowly, so as to break the
news gently.
</p>
<p>
“What?” cried three girls in one voice.
</p>
<p>
“Nah. Them green plants is dwarf string-beans,
and t’ lima beans is on the other side.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh goodness’ sake!” wailed Natalie, sitting
down plump on the radish bed. “All that work
done for nothing?”
</p>
<p>
Norma and Belle frowned at the poles, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
Janet laughed. “If this isn’t the funniest thing,
yet!” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
The greater part of the morning had passed
before the error made in the garden had been corrected.
Natalie was so tired by the time she
reached the house that she dropped wearily upon
the steps and sighed.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James came out upon the piazza when
she saw her approaching the house, and at the
sigh she said: “What’s wrong?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that horrid old garden is <em>such</em> a care! I
wish to goodness I had chosen stock-raising instead.
Then I could have had the pleasure of
watching the little things run about and show
their gratitude when one feeds them. But lifeless
old seeds and expressionless vegetables are
such uninteresting things to work for!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James understood that something had
gone awry, so she wisely remarked: “Oh, I don’t
know! Janet seems to have as much trouble with
her stock as anyone has with other work.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, she doesn’t have to dig holes and plant
bean poles for her pigs to climb up on!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. James barely kept from laughing outright
at the funny excuse given. But she replied:
“Janet had a dreadful time just now, trying
to catch two of the little pigs that escaped
and started to run down the road.”
</p>
<p>
“No,—really!” exclaimed Natalie, sitting up
with great animation. “Where is she now?”
</p>
<p>
“Trying to repair the fence that they broke
down. They are growing so big and strong that
the rickety enclosure she made at first will never
keep them in, now.”
</p>
<p>
“I just hope they get away and give her a
chase all the way to the Corners!” cried Natalie.
</p>
<p>
“Why should you wish such hard luck for
poor Janet?” asked Mrs. James, laughingly.
</p>
<p>
“Because she laughed at my bean poles and
refused to help us dig them up again.”
</p>
<p>
“Dig them up again! Did you bury them?”
</p>
<p>
Then Natalie found she had made an admission
that would have to be explained.
</p>
<p>
“No, not buried them, but we mistook the
plants. It was such an easy thing to do—to believe
the string-beans were limas, you know.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Then you never followed my advice
about tagging the different beds.”
</p>
<p>
But Natalie did not reply.
</p>
<p>
The following morning, Janet asked Frances
to inquire if there was a package for her at the
post-office, as it should have arrived several days
before.
</p>
<p>
“Is it a big package?” asked Frances.
</p>
<p>
“No, it’s a book that I ordered from the city.
It’s all about raising things. Not that I need to
find out about chickens and pigs, but I expect to
buy that calf from Mr. Ames, and Belle saw
some sheep in a pasture up in the Hills the other
day, when she was hunting for antiques. I am
wondering if they are difficult to raise. That is
why I want the book.”
</p>
<p>
The book arrived that morning, and Janet
straightway applied herself to studying its pages,
in order to learn what other farmyard animals
she could keep that would not give her too much
trouble, and repay her for the expense incurred.
</p>
<p>
The result of that reading was to rouse Janet’s
growing ambition to fever-heat. She determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
upon a plan by which she could borrow the capital
from her father and buy her stock without
further loss of time. But her experiences are
told in the volume following this one, called
“Janet: a Stock-Farm Scout.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie’s garden beds began to look most
flourishing, for every seed had sprouted and the
transplanted greens were growing like wildfire.
She began to figure ahead to find how soon she
might gather crops, but she kept this vision a
secret, as she knew the girls would tease if they
heard of it.
</p>
<p>
The very impressive paper that conveyed the
rights of Solomon’s Seal Troop to take its place
in the Girl Scout Organization arrived that
week, also, so that Natalie realized that great
things were already growing out of her coming
to Green Hill Farm that summer. But how they
multiplied and developed thrilling experiences
will be narrated in the second volume of this Girl
Scout Country Life Series.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
